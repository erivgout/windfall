 * Starting points for the subtractive synth. Each is the init sound with a
 * handful of settings moved, so reading one shows how the sound is made. A
 * browser for saved sounds comes later; these are all there is for now.
 *
 * Every sound sets its own `gain`, because what it adds to the init sound
 * (a second oscillator, unison, resonance, drive) changes how loud it is.
 * The gains are matched from renders of the real engine: one full-velocity
 * C5 of each sound peaks within 1 dB of -14 dBFS, so stepping through the
 * sounds does not jump in level, and a chord of four stays at or under
 * -6 dBFS. `presets.test.ts` has the measurements and holds the
 * gains to them. The bound in `peak-estimate.ts`, which takes the worst
 * case at every stage, still keeps a single note of every sound clear of
 * full scale.
 *
 * Init is the core's default settings, so its level is not set here.
