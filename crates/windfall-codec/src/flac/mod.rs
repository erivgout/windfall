//! Writing FLAC: lossless, about half the size of a WAV file.
//!
//! The encoder is Windfall's own. A stream is cut into blocks of 4,096
//! samples. Each channel of a block is stored as the best of four things:
//! one value, when the channel is constant; a fixed polynomial predictor
//! or a predictor fitted to the block, with what the predictor leaves
//! Rice-coded; or the samples as they are, when nothing else is smaller.
//! Two channels may be stored as their sum and difference instead. The
//! file states an MD5 sum of the audio and every frame a checksum, so a
//! decoder knows it got back exactly what went in.
