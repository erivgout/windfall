//! The polyphonic engine the additive instruments share.
//!
//! An additive instrument is a spectrum and a way of playing it. The
//! spectrum is the instrument's own business; everything else -- taking
//! notes, handing them voices, shaping each one with an envelope and
//! putting the result out in stereo -- is the same for all of them and
//! happens here.
//!
//! The engine runs on a fixed grid of [`CONTROL_PERIOD`] samples. A
//! parameter change sets a target, and the settings every voice reads glide
//! to it over [`GLIDE_MS`], one step per sample, so that a control can be
//! moved while notes sound without a click. Because the grid is counted in
//! samples rather than in `process` calls, the output does not depend on
//! how the host divides the audio into blocks.
