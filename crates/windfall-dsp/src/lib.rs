//! Windfall's built-in signal processing: the effects and instruments that
//! ship with the app, and the blocks they are made of.
//!
//! This crate knows nothing about audio devices, projects or the engine.
//! It turns numbers into numbers, which is what lets every processor be
//! tested by measurement.
//!
//! # The plugin interface
//!
//! Every effect implements [`Effect`] and every instrument implements
//! [`Instrument`]. A host that picks processors at run time holds them as
//! [`AnyEffect`] (usually inside an [`EffectSlot`], which adds bypass and
//! mix) and [`AnyInstrument`], with their settings in the matching
//! [`EffectParams`] and [`InstrumentParams`].
//!
//! The rules are the same for all of them:
//!
//! - **Allocation.** Building a processor and calling `prepare` allocate.
//!   Nothing else does: `process`, `set_params`, `set_tempo`, `reset` and
//!   the note calls are safe on a realtime thread. Dropping a processor
//!   frees memory, so the host sends it back to another thread to be
//!   dropped.
//! - **Parameters** are plain structs, one per processor, that can be
//!   saved, copied to the audio thread and exported to TypeScript. Each has
//!   sensible defaults, forces whatever it is given into range, and comes
//!   with a table of [`ParamInfo`] that describes every control for the UI
//!   and for automation (see [`ParamSet`]). A change glides, so it never
//!   clicks.
//! - **Blocks.** A processor's output does not depend on how the host
//!   divides the audio into blocks, and any block length from one sample up
//!   is fine.
//! - **Latency and tails** are reported, so a host can line tracks up and
//!   knows when a track has gone silent.
//! - **Bypass and mix.** No effect has a bypass of its own: switching an
//!   effect off is the [`EffectSlot`]'s job, which crossfades and then stops
//!   running it. The compressor, reverb and delay each have a `mix` control
//!   because blending them with the dry signal is part of how they are
//!   used; the slot adds a second, generic mix for every effect, with the
//!   dry signal delayed to match the effect's latency.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! Levels a mixer shares are linear gain, where 1.0 is unity. Thresholds
//! and gains inside dynamics and equalisers are in dB, because that is how
//! they are thought about. Frequencies are in Hz, times in milliseconds
//! (reverb decay in seconds), mixes and amounts run from 0 to 1, and pan
//! from -1 to 1. Each field's doc comment gives its unit, range and
//! default.
