/// A polyphonic subtractive synthesizer: three oscillators into a
/// resonant filter into an amplifier, each shaped per note.
///
/// # Signal path
///
/// Every voice mixes three oscillators (each stacked up to seven times for
/// unison), optionally overdrives the mix, filters it, and shapes its
/// volume with an envelope. A second envelope and two LFOs move the
/// filter; the LFOs can also move pitch, volume and pulse width.
///
/// The oscillators use four-point PolyBLEP corrections, and the whole voice
/// runs at twice the sample rate and is brought down through a half-band
/// filter. Together these put aliasing far below audibility even for the
/// highest notes, keep the filter in tune right up to 20 kHz, and catch
/// most of what the drive stage would otherwise fold back. The filter is a
/// trapezoidal state-variable filter, which stays stable at any cutoff and
/// resonance, however fast they move.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// A new note beyond the polyphony limit takes over from the oldest
/// released note, or the oldest held note if none is released. The note
/// that loses its voice is faded out over 4 ms in a spare voice, so
/// stealing never clicks. [`all_notes_off`](Instrument::all_notes_off)
/// uses the same fade.
///
/// With one unison voice every note starts its oscillators at the same
/// phase, so repeated notes sound identical. With more, each copy starts at
/// a random phase, as free-running oscillators would.
///
/// [`process`](Instrument::process) replaces the contents of its buffers.
/// The down-sampling filter delays the output by a fixed 12 samples,
/// reported by [`latency_samples`](Instrument::latency_samples).
