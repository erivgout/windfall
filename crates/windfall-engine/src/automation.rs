//! Automation: curves on the playlist that move a fader, a knob or the
//! tempo while the song plays.
//!
//! # Lanes
//!
//! The control side compiles every automation clip that sounds into lanes,
//! one per target. A lane is the whole story of its target along the song:
//! a row of spans that follow one another, each either a stretch of some
//! clip's curve or the value the last clip left behind. Which clip wins
//! where several overlap is settled there, so the audio thread only looks
//! a tick up.
//!
//! The value of a target is therefore a function of the place in the song
//! and nothing else. Before its first clip a target has no value from
//! automation and keeps the one stored in the project; from there on it
//! follows the clips and holds between them. Playback that begins in the
//! middle of a song finds every target where it would be had the song
//! played from the top.
//!
//! # Following a lane
//!
//! The audio thread looks at the lanes on a fixed grid of [`GRID`] frames,
//! counted from the engine's first frame and not from wherever a buffer
//! happens to begin, which keeps a render the same for every block size.
//! At each look it works out what every target is to be one grid step on
//! and sets it on its way there:
//!
//! - A gain or a pan is a ramp. It is aimed at the next value to arrive
//!   exactly one grid step later, so its course is the curve read every
//!   [`GRID`] frames and joined by straight lines, with no steps to hear.
//! - A setting of an effect or instrument is handed to the processor,
//!   which glides to it the way it does when a knob is turned.
//!
//! A corner of the curve, a jump in it or the edge of a clip therefore
//! takes effect within one grid step of its tick: at most 64 frames, which
//! is 1.33 ms at 48 kHz. A jump is spread over that step.
//!
//! Where playback begins, or is moved to, a gain or pan does not glide in
//! from its stored value: it is simply at the curve's value from the first
//! frame, so a song that opens on a fade in from silence opens silent. A
//! setting of an effect or instrument takes the few milliseconds its
//! processor glides in.
//!
//! # Letting go
//!
//! A target returns to its stored value when the song arrives, playing,
//! at a place before the target's first clip: over the 5 ms a fader move
//! takes. A song that stops does not let go at once. Its targets stay
//! where the song left them while anything of it is still to be heard, a
//! reverb's tail for one, and return over 100 ms once that has rung out or
//! the transport is used again. The processor decides when, and tells
//! [`step`] by looking at no place in the song at all. A gain or pan makes
//! its way back as one ramp. A setting of an effect or instrument is
//! walked back by the looks that follow, each of which hands the processor
//! the next value on the way.
//!
//! Nothing a lane does is written to the plan. The stored values stay
//! what they are.
