//! Audio clips: playlist clips that play a sample straight onto the
//! timeline, in slots allocated once.
//!
//! A clip starts on the frame of its start tick and then runs at its own
//! speed, whatever the tempo does. It plays into its mixer track where the
//! sampler voices do, so it goes through the same compensation delay, the
//! track's effects, its fader and its sends.
//!
//! # Level
//!
//! What a clip puts out is its audio times its gain and pan, its two
//! fades, and a short fade of the engine's own wherever its audio is cut.
//! The fades of the clip are equal-power curves between two ticks, shaped
//! over the time between them, so they follow the tempo like the clip's
//! edges do, a tempo that automation moves included. The engine's own is
//! a straight line of [`DECLICK_SECONDS`]: down into the frame the clip
//! ends on, whether that is the end of the clip, the end of the audio, or
//! the transport stopping or moving away, and up from the frame it starts
//! sounding on when that is not the first frame of its audio.
//!
//! A clip that starts on the first frame of its audio plays it as it is,
//! the way a sampler plays a one-shot: a drum loop that begins on a hit
//! keeps the hit. A start anywhere else is a cut and is faded: a clip
//! with an offset, a reversed clip, which starts on the file's last
//! frame, and playback that begins or is moved inside a clip.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! [`MAX_AUDIO_CLIPS`] clips sound at once. One more is not started, and
//! stays silent for its whole length. Clips get their slots as they
//! start, and clips that start together in the order of their ids, so the
//! ones left out are the ones that start last and, of those that start on
//! one tick, the ones with the highest ids. Playback that begins in the
//! middle of a song hands the slots to the clips under the playhead in
//! that same order. Clips that are fading out after a stop or a seek do
//! not count: they finish in spare slots.
//!
//! A clip that is left out is not forgotten: the player counts the clips
//! that would be sounding now had there been room, for the UI to warn
//! with, and every start it has refused, for an export to report.
