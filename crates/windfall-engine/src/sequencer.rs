//! The transport: where the playhead is and which notes fall on which
//! output frame.
//!
//! Musical time is tied to output frames by a [`Clock`], a straight line
//! from an anchor frame. A note plays on the first frame whose time is at
//! or after the note's tick, and that frame is computed from the anchor
//! alone, never by adding up block lengths. However the output is cut into
//! buffers, a note therefore lands on the same frame, exactly once.
//!
//! The clock does not go back at a loop point. It counts on, and the
//! sequencer remembers the clock tick at which the pass now playing began.
//! A tick on the clock therefore names one moment for as long as playback
//! is not moved by hand, which is what lets a sounding note keep the tick
//! it ends on: when the tempo changes, the clock is bent from that frame
//! on and the note's end moves with it.
//!
//! # A tempo that automation moves
//!
//! The clock stays a straight line even then. In song mode it counts the
//! plan's *warped* ticks ([`Plan::warp`]): the tick at which each moment
//! of the song would come at the stored tempo. Every place in the song is
//! warped on its way to the clock and every reading of the clock is
//! unwarped on its way back, so notes, clip edges and the playhead are
//! all placed by the tempo map, exactly, from one anchor. With a steady
//! tempo a tick is its own warped tick and nothing changes.
