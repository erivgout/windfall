//! Rendering a project as it comes: a block at a time, and its mixer
//! tracks apart from each other as stems.
//!
//! [`render_streaming`] is [`render`](crate::render) without the buffer: it
//! hands the audio on as it is made, so a long song never has to fit in
//! memory. [`render_stems`] does the same for several streams at once.
//!
//! # What a stem is
//!
//! A stem is one mixer track's part of the song as a stereo stream. The
//! master track is not a stem; its stream is the mix, which can be had
//! alongside. There are two kinds of stem, and they answer two questions.
//!
//! [`StemMode::TrackOutputs`] is what each track's meter shows: the sound
//! that leaves the track, after its effects, its fader and its pan, and
//! before it goes on to its output and its sends. A track that others
//! play into, a bus, is a stem like any other and holds what it was sent,
//! processed. A track's stem therefore knows nothing of what a bus or the
//! master does to it later. If every track plays straight into a master
//! that has no effects and stands at unity, the stems add up to the mix.
//! Put a reverb on a bus and they do not: the dry tracks and the bus are
//! all there, each as it left its own track. All stems come out of one
//! pass over the song.
//!
//! [`StemMode::ToMaster`] is what each track adds to the mix: the song
//! with only what plays straight into that track sounding, a channel's
//! notes or an audio clip, followed all the way to the output through the
//! track's effects, its sends, the buses it goes through and the master's
//! own effects and fader. A vocal's stem then carries the vocal's share of
//! the reverb bus. Where everything on the way is linear (faders, pans,
//! equalisers, reverbs, delays) the stems of all the tracks add up to the
//! mix exactly. A compressor or limiter on a bus or on the master works
//! on what it is given, so on a stem it reacts to that track alone, as it
//! does when the track is soloed, and the stems then do not add up. No
//! single pass can do this, because every stem needs every bus effect to
//! itself: the song is rendered once for each stem, and once more for the
//! mix, whose length the stems take.
//!
//! In both kinds, voices and audio clips take their slots exactly as in
//! the mix, so what the mix leaves out for want of a slot is left out of
//! the stems too, and mute and solo are as the project has them.
//!
//! # Time
//!
//! Every stream starts where the song starts and is exactly as long as
//! the mix, to the frame. The engine delays every path through the mixer
//! to match the slowest, so what leaves a track is behind the notes by a
//! figure of its own, and the master by the latency of the engine. Each
//! stream has what it is behind left off its front, which puts a note on
//! the first tick on the first frame of the mix and of its stem alike. An
//! automatic tail ends all of them where it ends the mix.
