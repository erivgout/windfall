//! The tempo map: how long the song takes to get to each of its ticks when
//! automation moves the tempo along the way.
//!
//! The sequencer's clock is a straight line from ticks to frames, which is
//! what lets it place every note on its exact frame from one anchor. A
//! tempo that changes would bend that line. The map takes the bend out
//! instead: it gives every tick of the song the tick at which the same
//! moment would come if the tempo never left the project's stored one. The
//! sequencer keeps time in those *warped* ticks, on its straight clock, and
//! asks the map whenever it goes from a place in the song to a time or
//! back.
//!
//! The warped tick of a place is the time it takes to get there, counted
//! in ticks of the stored tempo: the sum, over every tick on the way, of
//! the stored tempo over the tempo at that tick. The map is a row of
//! segments in each of which the tempo moves in a straight line, where
//! that sum has a closed form, so a position is exact to the precision of
//! the arithmetic and never drifts, however the output is cut into
//! buffers. A stretch of an automation curve that is bent is followed with
//! straight pieces a sixteenth of a beat long.
