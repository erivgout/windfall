//! Sampler voices: one playing copy of a sample each, in a pool allocated
//! once.
//!
//! The pool is the one hard limit on how much can sound at once. Up to
//! [`MAX_VOICES`] voices play at full level. A note that would be one more
//! steals a voice: the quietest one that is already releasing, or failing
//! that the one that started first, with the lowest slot winning a tie. The
//! stolen voice is not cut off but faded out over a few milliseconds in one
//! of [`FADING_SLOTS`] extra slots. Only when those are all taken as well,
//! which takes hundreds of notes within those few milliseconds, does the
//! fading voice nearest silence end at once. Every one of these choices
//! depends only on the voices themselves, so the same notes always steal
//! the same voices.
