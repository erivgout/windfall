//! Windfall's factory sounds: a drum kit and a few bass notes, synthesized by
//! the code in this crate so nobody else can hold a claim on them. The
//! results are checked in under `content/factory` and dedicated to the
//! public domain under CC0 1.0.
//!
//! [`manifest`] lists every sound, [`DEFAULT_KIT`] names the four a new
//! project starts with, [`generate`] writes the whole folder and [`verify`]
//! checks a folder against it.
//!
//! Rendering is deterministic: the same build writes the same bytes on every
//! run, and the synthesis sticks to arithmetic that IEEE 754 defines exactly
//! so that other platforms agree too.
