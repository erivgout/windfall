//! From an [`FlpProject`] to a Windfall [`Project`].
//!
//! The project is built the way the app builds one: by dispatching
//! [`Command`]s to a [`Document`] that starts out empty. Every rule the
//! commands enforce therefore holds for an imported project, and a value
//! FL Studio allows and Windfall does not is brought into range by the
//! same code that does it for a knob.
//!
//! The order is fixed, so the same file always gives the same project,
//! ids included: settings, mixer tracks, their routing, their effects,
//! channels, patterns and notes, the playlist, automation.
//!
//! What cannot come across is left out or stood in for, and the
//! [`ImportReport`] says which. The modules beside this one each convert a
//! part and say in their own documentation what they keep.
