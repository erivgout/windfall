//! What an FL Studio project file says, as plain data.
//!
//! [`parse`](crate::parse) fills these types from the events of a file.
//! Values are kept in the file's own units: ticks at the file's time base,
//! levels as the integers FL Studio stores. [`convert`](crate::convert)
//! turns them into Windfall's units, and the functions in
//! [`units`](crate::units) say how.
//!
//! A field that is `None` had no event in the file. Nothing is filled in
//! with a guess here.
//!
//! # How sure each part is
//!
//! Every type says where its layout comes from. Three levels are used:
//!
//! - **Agreed**: at least two of the sources read it the same way, and the
//!   files this crate was run over fit.
//! - **One source**: one source reads it, and nothing contradicts it.
//! - **Disputed**: the sources disagree. The comment says which reading
//!   was taken and why.
//!
//! The sources are PyFLP, DawVert, LMMS's importer and FLParser. The crate
//! documentation gives their links and licenses.
