//! What an import did, in words a user can read.

//! A report has a fixed row of categories. Each counts the things of its
//! kind by how they came across, and lists what there is to say about
//! them. The counts are of things (channels, notes, clips), one outcome
//! each: the worst of what happened to it. The lines are the details, and
//! a line that applies to several things says to how many.
//!
//! These types serialize to camelCase JSON and derive `TS`, so the shell
//! can hand a report to the interface as it is. They are not exported to
//! the bindings folder until the shell uses them.
