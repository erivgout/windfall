//! Bringing a [`MidiSong`] into a project.
//!
//! [`import`] works out what a song becomes in a project and returns it as
//! an [`ImportPlan`]: the channels, patterns and clips it will make, in
//! terms a dialog can show, and a list of everything that had to be fitted
//! or left behind. The plan knows nothing of any project. Once the user has
//! agreed to it, [`ImportPlan::command`] turns it into one command for the
//! project that is open, and dispatching that command is one undo step.

/// Works out what importing `song` into a project will do.
///
/// # What a song becomes
///
/// - **Channels.** Each MIDI channel of each track that has notes is a
///   *part*, and becomes one channel that plays the subtractive synth, with
///   a mixer track of its own as every new channel has. A track that plays
///   on one channel gives its name to it: the track's name, else its
///   instrument name, else the General MIDI name of its first program, else
///   "Track 3". The channels of a track that plays on several, as the one
///   track of a format 0 file does, are named after their programs, or
///   "Track 1 ch 2" for want of one. The MIDI drum channel is "Drums"
///   unless its track has a name to itself. A note's velocity of 1 to 127
///   becomes `velocity / 127`.
/// - **Drums.** With [`ImportOptions::drum_kit`], each of the kit's samples
///   that a drum part plays becomes a sampler channel, and the notes of
///   its keys move there, on the key that plays the sample as recorded.
///   Without a kit the part is a synth channel like any other, and the
///   plan says so.
/// - **Patterns and clips.** Each part gets a playlist track and the
///   patterns [`ImportOptions::patterns`] asks for, placed where their
///   notes belong. Lengths are whole bars of the song's first time
///   signature, 4/4 if it has none, and the song is as long as the file,
///   rounded up to a bar.
/// - **Tempo.** The project's tempo becomes that of the file's first tempo
///   event. If the tempo changes, a tempo automation steps through the
///   changes on a playlist track called "Tempo", in a clip as long as the
///   song. A file whose first tempo event is not at the start begins at
///   MIDI's default of 120 bpm, and so does the automation. A file with no
///   tempo event leaves the project's tempo alone, and a tempo event where
///   the song ends, with nothing left to play, is passed over. A tempo
///   is stored in an automation as a 32-bit fraction of the range, which
///   can move it by a millionth of itself.
/// - **Time signature.** The file's first, if it has one.
/// - **Volume and pan.** The first channel volume and pan of each part.
///   A volume of `v` becomes `0.8 * (v / 100)²`, and a pan of 0, 64 and
///   127 hard left, center and hard right.
///
/// # What is fitted
///
/// Everything here is listed in [`ImportPlan::adjustments`].
///
/// - A note that lasts past the end of its pattern is split there, because
///   a clip ends the notes of its pattern where it ends. The rest of the
///   note starts the next pattern as a new note.
/// - A song is at most [`MAX_SONG_TICKS`] long. Notes that start past that
///   are left out and notes that run past it are shortened.
/// - A tempo outside 10 to 522 bpm becomes the nearer of the two, and of
///   more than 4,096 tempo changes, 4,096 are kept, evenly spread.
/// - A time signature with more than 16 beats to the bar gets 16, and a
///   beat unit of a whole note becomes a half note and anything shorter
///   than a sixteenth note a sixteenth.
/// - Pitch bend, controllers other than the first volume and pan,
///   aftertouch, program changes and key signatures are not imported.
///   The [`MidiSong`] still holds them. Ordered meter changes are imported,
///   with colliding and over-limit events reported.
///
/// Two more things change without a line in the list. Names are cut to 64
/// characters and lose their control characters. And a `MidiSong` that is
/// not in its normal form is imported as its normal form.
