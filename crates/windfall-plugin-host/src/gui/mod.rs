//! Plugin editors as floating native windows.
//!
//! A plugin draws its own editor, but most will only draw it inside a
//! window the host provides. So opening an editor means making a top-level
//! window, handing it to the plugin as the parent, and keeping the two the
//! same size from then on. Either side may ask for a resize: the user by
//! dragging the frame, the plugin when it folds out a panel.
//!
//! Some plugins insist on making their own window instead. Those are shown
//! as they are, and the host has no window of its own for them.
//!
//! # Platforms
//!
//! The host window is implemented for Windows. On macOS and Linux only
//! plugins that open their own window work so far. The pieces to fill in
//! are a `HostWindow` for Cocoa and for X11 with the same four operations
//! as the one in `win32.rs`.
//!
//! # The event loop
//!
//! Windows of every editor belong to the thread that opened them, and that
//! thread has to run a message loop. In the app that is the shell's own
//! loop. A program without one can use [`pump_events`].
