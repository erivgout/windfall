//! The audio-thread half of a plugin.
//!
//! [`PluginInstance::activate`](crate::PluginInstance::activate) makes a
//! [`PluginProcessor`] on the main thread, with every buffer it will need.
//! It is `Send`: hand it to the audio thread, call it there, and hand it
//! back to be deactivated. Nothing in it allocates, locks or blocks while
//! it processes. The plugin's own code may, and the host cannot prevent
//! that. What it does about a plugin that misbehaves is described in
//! [`containment`](crate::containment).
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! Everything a plugin format has to do for one block is behind
//! [`ProcessorBackend`]. The processor around it holds what is the same for
//! every format: the event queue, the hand-over to and from the main
//! thread, block splitting, scrubbing and the watchdog. A backend that
//! talks to a plugin in another process would fit the same trait. See the
//! crate documentation for how its data would travel.
