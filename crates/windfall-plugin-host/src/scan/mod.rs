//! Finding out what a plugin file holds without trusting it.
//!
//! Loading a plugin runs its code, and plugin code crashes, hangs and shows
//! dialogs. So the app never loads a file to look at it. It starts the
//! `windfall-plugin-scan` program on one file, reads what that prints, and
//! gives up on it when it dies or goes quiet. A bad plugin costs the scanner
//! process and nothing else.
//!
//! One file can hold many plugins, and one of them hanging must not hide the
//! others. The scanner says which plugin it is about to create before it
//! does. When it dies there, [`scan_file`] blames that plugin and runs the
//! scanner again with the plugin left out.
