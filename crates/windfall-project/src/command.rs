//! Every edit to a project is a [`Command`].
//!
//! The UI, the command palette, scripting and the assistant all change a
//! project the same way: they build a command and dispatch it to the
//! [`Document`](crate::Document). Commands are plain data, so they cross the
//! IPC boundary as JSON.
//!
//! Patch structs hold one `Option` per field. `None` leaves the field alone.
//!
//! A number outside the range its field documents is brought into the range,
//! so a control can send what it has. Input that has no nearest valid value
//! fails the command instead: an id that does not exist, a key above 127, a
//! note or clip with no length, a color above 0xFFFFFF, NaN. An index past
//! the end of a list means the end.
//!
//! Time has two hard ends. A note cannot be added at, or moved to, a tick
//! at or past [`MAX_PATTERN_TICKS`](crate::model::MAX_PATTERN_TICKS), the
//! end of the longest pattern, where it could never play. A clip cannot end
//! past [`MAX_SONG_TICKS`](crate::model::MAX_SONG_TICKS), the end of the
//! longest song, and its offset cannot be larger than that either. Both
//! fail the command with a message that says so; a UI keeps its own edits
//! inside them.
