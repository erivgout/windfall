//! The `.windfall` file format: one pretty-printed JSON file holding a
//! [`Project`], next to the samples it owns and a `Backup` folder.
//!
//! # Beside the project
//!
//! A file may hold one thing that is not the project: `session`, a
//! [`ProjectSession`], which says how the project was being played when it
//! was saved. It is a key of its own in the file's JSON, after the
//! project's, and [`Project`] has no field for it. So it is not an edit:
//! it has no place in the undo history, a project is not changed by it,
//! and two projects that differ in nothing else are equal. A file without
//! it, such as every file from before it existed, loads the same project.
//!
//! # Backups and samples
//!
//! A backup is written exactly as a save would be, so the two can be
//! compared byte for byte. Its [`SamplePath::Project`] paths therefore stay
//! relative to the project folder, which is the folder that holds `Backup`,
//! and not to `Backup` itself. [`backup_origin`] tells a backup from a
//! project file, and [`sample_dir`] gives the folder to resolve either
//! one's project samples against.
