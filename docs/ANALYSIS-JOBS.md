# Native analysis foundation (M1 first stage)

`windfall-analysis` is a native control/worker crate on the accepted A-EDITOR
source contract at `1e24389eb58f4d59f3c0a121d946e1372ef7e585`. It does not edit a
project, connect to the engine, expose IPC, or ship an inference adapter. Its
authored test adapter copies selected PCM on real CPU workers and writes real
files. It proves lifecycle only. M1 Session/IPC/UI integration and M2–M4 actual
separation, denoising, pitch detection/editing and audio-to-MIDI remain required.
No parity row is closed by this delivery.

## Input and exact source checks

`CapturedInput::capture` runs away from recording/State/audio locks. It validates
shape, nonempty inclusive-start/exclusive-end range, checked frame/sample/byte
arithmetic and every finite sample. It retains a compact owned copy of the
whole immutable input; the selection is a checked slice of that copy. Copying
avoids retaining an external `Arc<Vec<f32>>` with hidden excess capacity. The
observed allocated capacity, rather than just selected frames, is charged.
No buffer is cloned into a status response. Ready review retains the original
captured PCM until cancellation or completed control-side retirement.

The Session supplies a canonical `CaptureStamp`:

- Document generation and edit revision, exact logical source key and binding
  digest, loaded original `AudioIdentity`, content fingerprint, prepared input
  frame/channel/rate shape, and exact selected range.
- `binding` must cover the accepted exact logical source and clip/render
  settings, including offset/reverse/stretch/pitch/gain/pan/fades/routing and
  timeline placement as appropriate. A digest of a pathname alone is inadequate.
  Canonical binding rules belong to the later Session adapter, which must
  preserve existing exact source/history guards.
- `ContentFingerprint::reader` hashes streamed actual file bytes with SHA-256
  and a byte cap. `ContentFingerprint::audio` hashes a versioned prefix, little
  endian sample rate/channel/frame fields and exact Float32 bits. File bytes
  and decoded PCM use different fingerprint kinds. Sizes/mtimes are never
  treated as content hashes. Paths do not enter the content fingerprint; path
  aliases to the same bytes compare equal, same-size changed bytes do not.
- A supplied verified fingerprint is a caller contract. For file input, the
  later loader must fingerprint the **exact file version decoded** into its
  loaded source and immutable view; independently hashing a mutable path after
  decoding does not establish that identity. Capture/recheck IO occurs off
  State. The final Session check must still compare the current loaded exact
  source allocation and canonical binding under its guards.

`Review::check_eligibility` compares all stamp fields and the entire model
manifest, including revision, checksum, provenance and shape, and requires a
live current source identity. It performs no IO and proves no atomic document
installation. Stale/refused work leaves the immutable review available until
explicit cancellation, consumption or shutdown.

## Execution and resource accounting

`JobManager` owns fixed real worker threads, a condition-variable queue and
bounded retained records. `submit`, `snapshot`, `wait`, `wait_for_change`,
`review`, `cancel`, `forget`, `claim`, `usage`, `retry_cleanup`, `shutdown` are
control-side operations. They must never run on audio or under Session State
or controller locks. The adapter has no mutable document or engine pointer.

Default limits: two workers, four queued jobs, sixteen total retained records,
256 MiB admitted memory, 1 GiB staging/publication/retained disk, 256 retained
output/temporary files, 64 MiB adapter scratch per job, 4,000,000,000 work units per job,
ten-minute execution/apply timeout. Input defaults cap whole captures at
64 MiB, 23,040,000 frames, mono/stereo and 8,000–192,000 Hz. Model cache defaults
cap a model at 256 MiB, cache at 1 GiB, 32 directory entries and one import.
Callers may configure tighter bounds. No CUDA/Python installation is required.

Each admission reserves:

- Actual compact input capacity, manifest's exact model bytes, **every retained
  manifest String/Vec capacity** (`ModelManifest::retained_bytes`), and two
  compact manifest copies for peak worker model/writer preparation. This includes
  unused provenance/device/role string capacity and unused output-vector slots;
  validating short lengths does not excuse retained large allocations.
- Declared adapter scratch, one largest decoded output PCM buffer, a 2 MiB
  codec/IO allowance, and 128 KiB for retained records, worst-case native
  staged/published paths, prebuilt commit metadata and scheduler storage.
- Three times the output byte budget for private staging, persistent publication
  and an owned temporary whose deletion may be refused, plus the declared
  aligned role count **and one sequential publication temporary slot**.
  Already published bytes/files
  stay charged even after job removal. Existing files in the dedicated output
  directory are included when the manager starts.
- Every queued/running/ready/apply-claimed/retiring input, scratch or output
  reservation. Consumption cannot release reservations before the deferred
  input/staging retirement actually finishes. Completed status records keep
  their fixed memory charge until explicit `forget`.

Adapters are trusted native implementations, configured once per manager;
requests cannot enqueue arbitrary adapter objects holding unaccounted audio.
They must use bounded provided scratch and checkpoints, declare any runtime
resident memory in scratch and add adapter-specific measurements. This is
cooperative admission accounting, not an OS memory sandbox. Existing codec
internals have their own guarded metadata/channel/rate limits and bounded PCM
sink; the allowance is not proof of an arbitrary codec/model runtime's maximum
RSS. A future adapter needs its own allocation/peak-memory audit and CPU deadline
measurements. Blocking filesystem calls and a codec decode cannot be preempted
mid-call; cancellation/deadline is checked before/after them and between bounded
sample/byte chunks. No hard realtime latency is claimed.

Statuses are `Queued → Running → Ready → Consumed`, with cancellation through
`Cancelling → Cancelled` and failures to `Failed`. Queued and ready work can be
cancelled without running an adapter. Running cancellation is cooperative and
cannot publish Ready after its cancellation wins the control lock. Consumed
cancellation is a no-op. A claimed apply refuses cancellation/removal, preventing
file retirement while a caller commits. Failure/cancellation releases buffers
and staging off the manager lock before releasing their reservations.

Job, review ticket and request IDs increase without reuse, including after
forgetting or replacing a manager/Session in this process. The process-wide
allocator is not reset by shutdown. Tickets are volatile and must never be
saved/reused across application process launches. The later IPC must encode
u64 IDs as decimal strings to avoid JavaScript integer precision loss.
ID allocation refuses before integer rollover; checked arithmetic
refuses oversized shape/budget/deadline calculations. Status/progress sequence
numbers increase, work never regresses/exceeds its budget, progress is coalesced
instead of appended to an unbounded event list, and transition history has at
most eight entries. Each apply gets a new request ID. Work exhaustion can refuse
an apply retry; it cannot create an unlimited stream of retained outputs.

Shutdown serializes joining, stops dequeuing once shutdown starts, cancels
queued/ready jobs and asks active workers to stop, then joins off all Session
locks. Outstanding apply/retirement owners keep the shared accounting alive.
An apply dropped during shutdown retires staging; an acknowledged real commit
retains its sources. `forget` accepts only failed/cancelled/consumed records with
finished retirement. Ready work must be explicitly cancelled or consumed.

## Explicit local models

`ModelManifest` fixes ID, version, revision, exact SHA-256 and byte length/limit,
source revision/origin/author, weight SPDX/license reference, adapter ID/version,
CPU device, exact input channels/rate/frame cap and one to sixteen unique output
roles with channel counts. Provenance strings and roles are bounded. Weight
terms are separate from runtime/code terms. Nothing searches for guessed
weights, downloads or uploads. Missing models return an explicit import/offline
error. There is no production adapter disguised as successful inference.

`ModelCache::import_reader` / `import_file` reserve bounded import count/cache
disk, stream into an owned `NamedTempFile`, validate exact size and SHA-256,
sync and publish with `persist_noclobber`. Cancellation before publication
removes only staging. Publication is the import commit point; cancellation
after it cannot remove cache data. Existing and concurrently won entries are
read and rehashed rather than trusted by name/metadata. Invalid existing entries
are refused and preserved; users must explicitly repair their own cache.
`load` rehashes a bounded compact immutable model-byte copy on the worker before
the adapter runs, avoiding inference against a changing cache pathname.

Cache and output roots are dedicated single-control-authority directories;
cache clones share reservations. Symlinks/non-files in cache/output inventory
are refused. Independent authorities/external arbitrary writers are not an
interprocess quota system or a hostile filesystem security boundary. Collisions
preserve competitor bytes. The three ownership roots must be disjoint, with
fresh exclusively owned staging. Crashed staging is refused on next startup,
never speculatively garbage-collected.

## Artifacts and publication/commit protocol

`ArtifactWriter` creates a unique private job directory. Portable flat relative
names reject separators/drives/ADS/traversal/dots/spaces/device names. Artifact
names and publication destinations reject ASCII case aliases before any writes,
including on a case-sensitive host. Relative names compact unused String capacity.
Outputs must be Float32 WAV, one per declared role, exactly aligned selected frame count
and original frame origin, at the manifest rate and role channel count. Chunk
writes cap at 4096 whole-frame finite samples. Disk/count/byte/frame overflows,
nonfinite data, missing/extra/duplicate roles and bad paths are refused. Encoded
helper output first streams into bounded owned staging, then is probed for
exact aligned Float32 WAV before creating a decoder and normalizing to this
contract. Compressed helper codecs need a separate memory audit and are refused
by this first foundation. Completed WAVs are independently decoded for shape
and finiteness and hashed before review. Both decodes use the additive codec
`decode_file_strict_with` entry: nonfinite samples return `CodecError::Corrupt`
before ordinary sanitation. `decode_bytes_strict_with` uses the same supported
parser/layout/byte limits. Every ordinary decode entry keeps its previous
signature, defaults, damaged-file handling and NaN/Inf-to-zero behavior. No
format, model runtime or dependency was added. No output PCM is retained between files.
Codec replacing-writer APIs see only private staging, never persistent targets.

The Session integration must follow this protocol:

1. Capture a canonical source/view/stamp with recording exclusion before State;
   perform view preparation, fingerprinting/copying/admission off all those
   guards, then recheck exact source/document before treating the job as current.
2. Poll/await status; get a bounded review with capture/model/output metadata.
   Review itself cannot edit anything.
3. `claim(ticket, current_stamp, manifest)` checks pure eligibility and gives one
   `ApplyLease`. `prepare(relative_names)` copies verified staging into owned
   temporary output files, syncs and atomically publishes each with no replacement.
   Caller output names must be uniquely chosen. There is no multi-file atomic
   publication claim; a later collision can leave earlier final files retained.
4. Decode published outputs, prepare the ordinary pool/checked command batch and
   `Controller::prepare_project` off State. Recheck actual file content and
   loaded source state as required by the Session source contract.
5. Acquire recording exclusion **before State**, recheck capture/source/request,
   exact clip and every prepared pool source, then dispatch **one checked batch**
   using the existing prepared-plan publication/retirement path. A recording,
   project replacement, stale edit/model/source or rejected batch changes no
   document/history/pool/engine state. Pure crate tests do not prove this step.
   `PreparedApply::check_eligibility` compares borrowed canonical fields directly;
   do not call the allocating `review()` here. `prepare()` has already built
   bounded output metadata, exposed by `artifacts()`, before entering these guards.
6. Only after the actual caller commit, call
   `PreparedApply::acknowledge_commit`. This infallible transition does no IO,
   codec work, allocation, deallocation or worker joining. It moves prebuilt
   metadata and defers even the progress closure's destruction. It returns
   `AppliedAssets` with deferred
   retirement. Release all Session/recording guards, then `retire`/drop the assets.
   Their final files remain external sources for undo/redo/save/archive.

Dropping a lease/prepared apply after failed commit returns Ready, retaining
input/staging and any already published metadata. The first attempted destination
set is pinned; retries reuse the same validated final files rather than generating
more orphans. Cancellation after Ready removes only staging, even after partial
publication. Published files are never deleted on failure/stale/refusal/cancel,
job forgetting, controller retirement, shutdown or undo. Final bytes/files are
permanently charged for the manager lifetime and re-inventoried on restart; this
finite budget can require another directory/explicit user-owned recovery. There
is no speculative source GC or claim that a failed publication/commit is free.

Every publication temporary is registered on its job immediately after exclusive
creation, before fallible copying/checksum/sync/rename. At most one exists per
job. A failed destructor deletion is followed by explicit owned-path cleanup;
a refusal keeps that path and its disk/file reservations charged. Apply retries
must remove it before writing another temporary. Cancellation/consumption retain
the record and reservations until both private staging and publication-temporary
cleanup succeed; repeated cancel/forget/admit cannot bypass the quotas.

`retry_cleanup` is explicit and bounded to that job's private child directory
and exact registered publication-temporary path. Replacement files/symlinks at
the private directory, and directories/symlinks at the temporary path, are
refused for manual recovery. It never takes a final path, cache path or another
job's path. No cleanup unlinks committed or competitor destinations. Ordinary
Drop is only the first attempt; retirement checks both tracked paths. A crash
leftover in the publication root is counted by the next startup inventory and
is never guessed to be garbage.

## First-stage verification and next exclusive window

Tests live in auto-discovered `tests/analysis_jobs.rs` and library unit tests.
The authored CPU fixture contract is in `tests/fixtures/README.md`; model SHA-256
is `07f6812eb7ac451adc4b010bb18b2fe098ce235498880c80ead3fad519e47d33`.
The exact 74-byte Float32 WAV SHA-256 is
`4dbb9f64ee9794914f7a9bf01ed95c3775858a4bb9413877a99218b88077528b`.
Barrier seams exercise native queue/active cancellation and shutdown without
timing sleeps. Tests inspect actual decoded files, retained bytes and directories.
They cover whole-input capacity/bounds/NaN/Inf/ranges, queue/count/concurrency,
memory/disk/work/integer overflow, monotonic transitions, absent/corrupt models,
stream read/checksum/size/cancellation errors, output codecs/IO and alignment,
ready/claimed/consumed cancellation, stale stamp/model revisions, no-clobber
collisions, refusal/retry/double consume and staged versus persistent lifetime.
No hardware, packaged app, Session undo/save/archive, browser UI or real inference
verification is claimed by these crate tests.

R1 at immutable `89d5ffbd3cb426d62d36786636a1e0a6e032b8b8` identified five
foundation defects. Compiled RED regressions reproduced a locked publication
temporary releasing its reservation, undercharged high-capacity manifests,
20 allocations/18 frees in the final seam, sanitized encoded nonfinite PCM
reaching Ready, and Windows case aliases reaching Ready/partial publication.
All five repairs have compiled GREEN native regressions. Extended checks cover:

- An actual Windows no-delete file handle blocks two Ready apply retries and
  four cancel/forget/admit/cleanup cycles. A 12,288-byte/two-file reservation
  stays charged alongside the pre-inventoried 10-byte competitor; closing the
  handle and explicitly retrying removes only the owned temporary, releases
  reservations and leaves competitor bytes unchanged.
- An 8 MiB String plus 4 MiB output-vector capacity retains 12,583,031 manifest
  bytes, charged within 14,815,904 admitted bytes while Running and Ready.
  A valid queued manifest adds 4,194,486 retained bytes (21,243,263 total admitted);
  a separate 128 MiB-capacity valid String is refused by the 24 MiB manager.
  Actual Rust heap above the test baseline was 12,603,238 bytes at the worker
  barrier and 12,606,051 after Ready, confirming the charged capacity remained
  retained rather than merely predicting admission from source.
- Thread-local allocator/free guards measure **zero allocations and zero frees**
  across borrowed valid/stale eligibility plus acknowledgement, for both one
  and sixteen prebuilt output metadata records. Retirement happens afterwards.
- Authored native Float32/Float64 WAVs containing NaN/+Inf/-Inf are refused by
  both strict file and byte decoding. Ordinary decoding still sanitizes all six
  cases to zero. Finite PCM and the same decoded-byte limits remain compatible;
  a real analysis helper worker refuses encoded Float32 nonfinite outputs.
- Native artifact case aliases preserve the first WAV's PCM/bytes/stored SHA;
  destination case aliases refuse before publishing any file. Existing partial
  publication, competitor, failed caller commit, stale and history-owner tests
  continue to preserve finals without speculative deletion.

The one-second authored 48 kHz stereo lifecycle emits exactly 384,058 bytes,
SHA-256 `1704336f534fe5e5105dc93e12b068a27ce34bc432c54955794ab16134fe886f`.
One measured run took 13,669 microseconds, admitted 3,001,010 memory bytes and
measured 939,174 Rust heap bytes above its baseline (which excludes the original
caller source). It reserved 3,145,728 disk bytes; after publication 2,761,670
remained reserved and 384,058 were persistent; retirement released the remainder.
This is a lifecycle sample, not a performance guarantee, RSS measurement,
real-time result or inference/ML-quality evidence.

Run one Cargo at a time in Git Bash after `source scripts/msvc-env.sh`, with
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1`, `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/m1-native` and
task-local `TS_RS_EXPORT_DIR`. Cargo generated only the new windfall-analysis
lock entry, referencing already locked packages; subsequent checks use
`--locked --offline`. Verify only owned Rust formatting and strict crate
`--all-targets` Clippy. No full desktop/workspace/UI build or binding generation.

Proposed next child ownership, after acceptance and explicit parent grant:
- New `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/session/analysis_jobs.rs` and
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/session/tests/analysis_jobs.rs`,
  `crates/windfall-ipc/src/analysis.rs`, and
  `apps/desktop/src/features/analysis/*`, including source/history/save/archive
  and UI review tests.
- Serialized registration only: root `Cargo.toml` analysis dependency entry,
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, native `session/mod.rs` module/Inner
  construction/drop, `session/tests/mod.rs` test registration,
  `crates/windfall-ipc/src/lib.rs`, native `commands.rs` and `src/lib.rs` invoke
  registrations, `apps/desktop/src/lib/ipc/{backend,tauri,mock}.ts`, and
  `apps/desktop/src/features/playlist/audio/clip-inspector.tsx` action entry.

Final native seam: off-State `claim`/`prepare`/borrowed `artifacts` plus loaded
pool/command/controller preparation; recording-before-State borrowed
`PreparedApply::check_eligibility` and one real checked document batch;
`acknowledge_commit` only after that commit; `AppliedAssets::retire` after every
guard. Decimal-string IDs must remain process-volatile on IPC. Shared files
remain closed until parent acceptance and explicit exclusive window grant.
Existing editor/edit/library/
files/clip_processing, sampler/cache and Document exact-source/history internals
remain reserved. Parent owns generated TS/WASM, shared root documentation/parity
and final integration/publication. Mock must honestly report native inference
unavailable. No production adapter is available for a user-visible successful
analysis until a separately reviewed actual algorithm/model is integrated.

## Registered native app adapter (M1 infrastructure stage)

The analysis-only registration window adds `Session::analysis_*`, an Inner-owned
`analysis_jobs::Service`, exported IPC DTOs, blocking native command wrappers,
Backend/Tauri/browser adapters and an Analysis action in the selected audio clip
inspector. The native invoke list lives in `commands::handler`; `src/lib.rs`
already installs that handler and needs no second registration. The foundation
commits `89d5ffbd` and `f006ce1b` are unchanged. This stage uses the existing
fallible `Controller::prepare_project` and existing checked Document batch,
source synchronization, history, save and archive implementations.

**Production has no inference adapter.** Native capability reports `native:
true, available: false` with an explicit reason; submit refuses with
`analysis:unavailable`. Importing a model does not install an algorithm. The
browser reports native unavailability and refuses import, jobs, review and
apply; it never synthesizes an analyzed result. The private `cfg(test)` adapter
uses the pinned authored CPU fixture and real workers/WAVs solely to exercise
the infrastructure. Denoising, separation, pitch and audio-to-MIDI remain
unavailable and M2–M4 remain required. This is no ML or 342-row parity closure.

### Service and IPC ownership

`Session::new` constructs the service with
`settings.recordings_dir()/Analysis`, without filesystem work or workers under
State. `analysis_model_import` explicitly verifies a user-supplied local file
against an ID/version/revision, SHA256, exact bytes, shape and provenance/license
manifest. No network transfers or guessed model metadata occur. The registry
retains at most eight compact manifests, with monotonic revisions per ID/version;
a changed manifest at the same revision is refused. Registry manifests are
process-local; reopening the app requires explicit reimport, including actual
checksum verification of an already cached file. Binary checksum verification
does not independently establish the caller's provenance or weight-license claim.

One lazy native manager belongs to this Inner, with one worker, two queued jobs,
eight retained records, 192 MiB admitted job memory, 1 GiB output disk and 256
published/temporary file slots. Whole capture PCM and encoded source bytes each
cap at 16 MiB; combined output PCM caps at 32 MiB; adapter scratch reserves
32 MiB; work caps at 500,000,000 units and 120 seconds. Native model limits are
64 MiB per file, 256 MiB cache, eight entries and one import. Model cache,
unique Session/Jobs staging and persistent Outputs have separate ownership.
Session staging uses a retained unique namespace, rather than a recursive parent
TempDir destructor; shutdown removes only empty parent containers. Refused
native cleanup remains evidenced and charged, and can be retried/forgotten only
through the foundation's rules. No final or competitor is garbage-collected.

All u64 IDs/counts/revisions are canonical decimal strings on IPC; conversion
never uses a JS number. Job, ticket, submit-request and apply-claim identities use
the foundation's process-global monotonic allocator across manager replacement
and fail before rollover. None are saved in a project. Control methods expose
capability, local model import, submit, status, cancel, forget, retry cleanup,
review, apply, preparation cancellation and shutdown. Claim/publish/retire are
internal parts of apply, rather than remotely held leases that could survive a
window indefinitely. Prefixes distinguish unavailable/modelAbsent/stale/
cancelled/samplerPreparation/budget/io/collision/shutdown failures.

The service's bounded preparation gate serializes capture/import/apply. Status
and cancellation do not wait for that gate. Explicit shutdown cancels ongoing
preparation, waits for the gate, cancels/joins workers off State and retains the
manager for status/cleanup evidence. Inner ownership invokes the same shutdown
on service drop; dropping the last Session is a control-thread operation. A
trusted adapter must still obey cooperative chunk checkpoints; blocking codec,
filesystem and existing sampler preparation calls cannot be interrupted mid-call.

### Capture and actual guarded commit

Capture first acquires recording-before-State, copies the exact clip/sample
metadata and compact source handle, and records generation, edits, replacement
request, roots and tempo. Off State it opens the native source with Windows
no-write/no-delete sharing, reads bounded exact bytes, hashes those bytes and
decodes that same snapshot. Its decoded PCM fingerprint must equal the currently
loaded immutable source. Neither mtime/size nor the sample-cache key substitutes
for content. Existing `audio_edit::render_view` supplies playback-equivalent
clip PCM before mixer effects; analysis preflights its narrower memory limits
before rendering. The canonical binding digest covers the whole clip, sample,
tempo and path roots; the retained original AudioIdentity remains distinct from
the rendered capture identity. Tempo automation is explicitly refused. A final
capture guard rechecks recording and the exact original source/document binding
before job admission.

Apply verifies the review submit request and current pinned manifest, rehashes
the actual source off State and retains its file-version authority. It snapshots
the current Document/pool/load intent using the existing Session snapshot seam;
candidate dispatch, claim, publication, strict output decode/checksum/cache-PCM
comparison, complete candidate pool/commands and fallible controller preparation
then run off State. Published output handles are acquired before decoding and
held through commit. Windows tests demonstrate that writes and deletes of both
original and output files are refused throughout the final preparation window.
On platforms without that sharing authority, external filesystem mutation after
recheck is not an interprocess transaction guarantee; this adapter targets the
native Windows app.

The final recording-before-State section checks generation/edit/replacement,
exact clip/sample/path/tempo/source identity, full original pool identity,
loaded/loading/failed sets, current sampler-preparation request and cancellation.
It borrows `PreparedApply::check_eligibility`, executes **one actual checked
Document batch**, installs the prepared sources/controller, and calls
`acknowledge_commit` only after the real commit. Input/progress/staging retirement
and candidate/file-handle drops occur after all guards. The two foundation calls
are measured allocation/free-free in actual one-output and sixteen-output
Session commits; existing Document and controller publication are not claimed
to be allocation-free. Snapshot metadata copies and application-owned project
history/pools are not an OS heap budget or a sandbox for a future runtime.

Complete-range replacement removes the original clip and creates derived
samples/clips in one undo entry. Partial ranges only add clips, at the nearest
timeline tick to their rendered frame origin, with duration rounded up to ticks;
the stored PCM/frame origin remains exact. Invalid partial replacement is refused
before any publication. Source assets and original file bytes remain intact.
Published files persist after failed/stale preparation, cancellation, consumption,
forget and shutdown, including history/save/archive use; retries pin the same
bounded destinations and cannot accumulate additional output sets. Failed apply
restores Ready; consumed apply cannot execute twice and later cancellation is a
no-op. The existing pending-load attachment barrier survives apply and undo.

### App controls and attributable checks

The panel displays native availability, explicit local manifest/file import,
pinned model selection, exact frame endpoints, progress/status, cancellation,
cleanup retry/forget, source/model/output hashes and author/license provenance,
review and explicit apply. Project replacement/selection changes invalidate the
panel; late replies do not install a patch. Unmount and late-submit retirement
use at most 600 control polls over 120 seconds, never a static job map or direct
filesystem deletion. A cleanup refusal preserves native quota/evidence and
reports the retained job identity instead of removing files.

Fourteen registered real Session tests cover actual one-batch commit/undo/redo/
save/reopen/portable archive, complete/partial range placement, exact same-size/
same-mtime file changes, capture and final recording authority, source/full-pool/
loaded/loading/failed/sampler-request/generation/edit races, model/request
staleness, absent model and invalid ranges, actual fallible sampler budget
refusal, pending-load history intent, queued/running/ready/consumed cancellation,
shutdown joining off State, global IDs across manager replacement, persistent
final ownership, native Windows sharing and publication collision preservation.
The one- and sixteen-output checks observe `(eligibility, acknowledgement) =
(0, 0)` allocator calls, including frees; sixteen committed files leave zero
reserved disk bytes/file slots after retirement. The latest targeted native run
also passed three existing slicer analysis regressions (seventeen tests in
1.30 seconds) and eleven IPC checks (one decimal/serde/TS contract plus ten
task-local DTO export checks). One-output Ready admission charged 35,784,946
memory bytes, 203,808 reserved disk bytes and two file slots; consumption kept
one 858-byte final and 131,072 record bytes, with zero remaining reservations.
Sixteen outputs kept 13,728 final bytes and the same record charge, with zero
remaining disk/file reservations. Source-content staleness is tested while
preserving native file identity as well as size and mtime. Seven frontend tests
exercise decimal protocol, honest browser refusal, stale selection review, late
submit retirement and late actual project-replacement patch delivery. TypeScript
checking, scoped ESLint and scoped Prettier pass. Checks are executed with one
Cargo process, `--locked --offline`, jobs/threads one and the unique native target.
Strict `--all-targets` Clippy passed for analysis, IPC and desktop; owned Rust
formatting and diff checks passed. No desktop window, live device, real inference
or end-to-end native webview execution is claimed by these headless checks.

The only app-stage lockfile change is one `"windfall-analysis"` reference in the
existing windfall-desktop dependency list, generated offline. No existing package
version/checksum/features or other lock bytes changed; root/desktop manifests add
only the approved workspace path reference. Parent still owns generated bindings,
fresh composed integration and independent review. No T1/root sources were
imported, and closed editor/history/cache/project/engine implementations were
left unchanged.

## Dependency license evidence

The only dependency graph addition is the native analysis package; sha2 0.10.9
and tempfile 3.27.0 already existed in Cargo.lock. Default features only (std;
tempfile randomness via existing getrandom). No runtime, FFI model binary,
network library or weights were added. Existing windfall-core/codec/serde/
thiserror dependency versions are reused without upgrades; preserve codec's existing Symphonia MPL-2.0,
Vorbis BSD-3-Clause and LAME LGPL obligations described in its manifest.

Local primary license files from the exact locked registry source were inspected
on 2026-10-08. The added references use the MIT option, compatible with this
GPL-3.0-or-later native app; MIT notices must accompany distributions. A table
of exact primary-file hashes and attribution follows. Platform-transitive
licenses are recorded even where this Windows build does not select them.
