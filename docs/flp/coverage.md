# FL project import coverage

Verified 2026-10-07 on Windows/MSVC, with the crate also built for
wasm32-unknown-unknown. This is evidence of structural import, not a claim of
identical playback or support for every FL Studio release.

## Sources and licensing

See [crate notices](../../crates/windfall-flp/NOTICE.md) for exact pinned revisions,
copyright notices, license evidence and dependency licenses. PyFLP, DawVert and
FLParser grant GPL-3.0-or-later; the LMMS v1.0.3 importer grants GPL-2.0-or-later.
PyFLP's metadata says GPL-3.0, but its relevant source headers explicitly permit
version 3 or later. The crate declares the workspace GPL-3.0-or-later license.
No GPL-3.0-only constraint was found in these sources. Helpers are serde and
thiserror (MIT OR Apache-2.0), ts-rs (MIT), and test-only proptest (MIT OR Apache-2.0).

No FL Studio binaries or plugins were decompiled or disassembled. Format layouts
and formulas come from the credited open implementations. Test streams are
constructed by the original CC0-1.0 writer in tests/common/mod.rs. No Image-Line
projects, presets, samples, artwork or third-party binary fixtures are committed.

## Real-file verification

Files were read from the GPL-licensed [PyFLP test asset tree](https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP/tree/f937126b888ce94271bfea631b89166c74056530/tests/assets),
cloned into `C:/Users/ewhee/AppData/Local/Temp/windfall-flp-sources/PyFLP`, outside
this checkout. Nothing from that folder is distributed by Windfall. The inspected
revision is f937126b888ce94271bfea631b89166c74056530. The inspection example prints
counts, report outcomes and the actual Project::check result.

| PyFLP asset | FL version | Parse | Channels | Patterns | Notes | Inserts | Playlist items | Unknown ids | Conversion |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| FL 20.8.4.flp | 20.8.4.2576 | success, 0 diagnostics | 19 | 5 | 48 | 127 | 22 | 31, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 157, 158 | Project::check = Ok; 18 rack channels, 5 patterns, 112 notes after layer expansion, 21 clips, 0 automations, 15 retained unsupported plugin states |
| patterns/multi-channel.flp | 20.8.4.2576 | success, 0 diagnostics | 2 | 1 | 2 | 127 | 0 | 31, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 | Project::check = Ok; 2 channels, 1 pattern, both notes, 0 clips |

All 48 source note records in the larger asset are retained. Four layer notes
expand to their children; notes targeting audio/automation channels are kept on
silent samplers. This produces 112 Windfall notes. One unsupported automation
playlist item is dropped and reported; the other 21 item placements survive.
The output will not sound like the source without missing instruments/effects
and samples. Verification supplied no sample directories, so unresolved source
paths are expected. Empty playlist track records and touched insert records
are imported too; counts below include them.

Per-category reports for the larger asset (exact / approximated / placeholder /
dropped): settings 3/0/0/4; channels 0/10/9/0; samples 0/1/0/0; patterns 5/0/0/0;
notes 9/39/0/0; mixer 99/5/0/0; effects 0/0/10/0; playlist 5/516/0/1; other
0/0/0/427. Other includes uninterpreted event occurrences and markers, not
427 lost musical clips. For multi-channel: settings 2/1/0/0; channels 0/2/0/0;
patterns 1/0/0/0; notes 0/2/0/0; mixer 104/0/0/0; playlist 0/500/0/0; other
0/0/0/57. Report counts refer to source items, not expanded layer notes.

The same repository's six intentionally corrupted assets were checked:
invalid-data-magic, invalid-header-magic, invalid-header-size and invalid-ppq
return readable errors; invalid-event-size yields a partial model with one
diagnostic and a checked project; invalid-format preserves the unfamiliar
format in the header rather than panicking. These files do not establish
additional version coverage.

Reproduce, from this checkout in Git Bash:

```sh
source scripts/msvc-env.sh
cargo run -p windfall-flp --example inspect -- "C:/external/PyFLP/tests/assets/FL 20.8.4.flp"
```

No real projects from FL Studio 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 21, 2024, 2025 or 2026 were
available in the checked source asset tree. Their coverage is unverified.
Generated historical and 21-era fixtures are useful layout tests, not substitutes
for a multi-version real-project corpus.

## Parsed and converted scope

| Feature | Reader evidence | Conversion and limits |
|---|---|---|
| FLhd/FLdt, typed events, unknown ids, version | PyFLP + LMMS; all four event ranges tested | File size capped at 512 MiB; object counts and diagnostics capped; unknown data preserved up to the documented retention cap and all occurrences counted |
| Tempo/fine tempo, signature, text, master controls | Multiple sources; old denominator meaning from PyFLP | Tempo, signature and name imported via commands; unsupported metadata and main pitch reported; master volume folded into master gain |
| Sampler controls, sample paths, cut groups, reverse, window/envelope | Multiple sources; envelope timing is a DawVert fit | External normalized references; variables resolve only from options; unresolved paths stay written; asymmetric groups, stretching, looping, LFOs and unsupported effects reported |
| Generator/wrapper/layer | Wrapper records from PyFLP/DawVert; type 4 interpretation follows DawVert | Three-oscillator source synth maps approximately to subtractive synth; unsupported plugins are silent samplers with raw wrapper state in Conversion.plugins; layers expand notes with cycle protection |
| Notes/patterns/legacy steps | Modern 24-byte and historical 20-byte generated records; real 20.8.4 records | Exact ticks when representable; nearest-tick rounding otherwise; step-grid pattern lengths; fine pitch, slides, release, group/modulation and MIDI-channel expression reported as unsupported |
| Mixer slots, mute/solo, routing/sends | Multiple implementations; generated controls and routing fixtures | Command-enforced cycles refused; 128 tracks, 10 effects per track; EQ/compressor/reverb/delay have partial parameter translations; limiter/delay 3 use defaults; unsupported effect states retained separately |
| Playlist tracks/clips/audio | 32-byte and generated 60-byte records; real 20.8.4 | Pattern position/length/offset/mute imported; audio references, reverse, pitch, approximate fades/gain imported; track name/mute imported; colour/height unsupported; channel offsets disputed and reported |
| Automation points/links | PyFLP/DawVert/FLParser layouts; generated link tests | Channel volume/pan, track volume/pan, existing send gain, effect mix, understood effect parameters and tempo; tension fitted/approximate, hold mode supported; unsupported targets/controllers/formulas/smoothing reported; instrument-parameter links currently unsupported |
| Markers and extra arrangements | Generated layouts | Kept in source model, dropped with counts because Windfall has no marker fields and only one arrangement |

Automation and channel clip offsets remain a disputed area: open implementations
use different units. Audio offsets follow DawVert's four units per quarter note
before stretching; automation offsets use the quarter-note interpretation.
Nonzero offsets are reported as approximate. Bent curve shape and fader gain
fits do not imply acoustic equivalence. Native source parameters outside the
Windfall processor's range are sanitized through the same commands as the app.

## Test and build evidence

Final command: `cargo test -p windfall-flp --quiet` (with a unique external TS_RS_EXPORT_DIR).
72 unit tests + 41 model/writer tests + 15 conversion tests = 128 passing tests;
0 failures and 0 ignored tests; doc tests: 0. Property tests use 128 cases each:
constructed notes round-trip writer/reader and convert deterministically to a
checked project; arbitrary hostile event bytes never panic. Explicit PPQ tests
cover 96, 192, 384, 480, 960 and odd bases. 384 PPQ is not a divisor of 960:
odd source ticks require rounding; even source ticks are exact.

Required checks: `cargo clippy -p windfall-flp --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
`cargo fmt -p windfall-flp -- --check`, and
`cargo build -p windfall-flp --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` all pass.
No shell or UI was changed.

## Integration API

```rust
pub fn parse(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<FlpProject, FlpError>;
pub fn convert(flp: &FlpProject, options: &ConvertOptions) -> Conversion;
pub fn import(bytes: &[u8], options: &ConvertOptions) -> Result<Conversion, FlpError>;
```

Conversion contains Project, ImportReport and Vec<PluginPlaceholder>. The shell
should read bytes, call import, preserve unsupported states for a future plugin
host, and create a fresh Document only after Project::check succeeds. Recommended
IPC: `import_flp(path, options)` returns a snapshot plus report (and retained
plugin state storage handles). UI: show version/read diagnostics, category counts
and expandable plain-language losses; offer missing sample-directory selection
and clearly identify silent placeholders before playback. This crate does not
check whether referenced samples exist or implement hosted-plugin recovery.
