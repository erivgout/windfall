# Windows audio-plugin process bridge

Design proposal for N4, based on `71a0b76f`. Implementation and measured results
will be recorded below as they become available. This document does not close
the bridge or native editor parity rows.

## ABI4 authoritative reset repair (current host contract)

This host-only increment follows immutable `6b228e12`. It does not import or
activate the frozen production facade, change native fixture/thread identity,
or close P1 off-lock preparation/retirement or the full meter-render precheck.
The older ABI2/ABI3 sections below retain their historical evidence; mapping
ABI4 and Hello3 now supersede their reset/startup compatibility contracts.

The actual Windows CI failures were the unchanged second-capture oracle in
`vst3_capture_does_not_relabel_dsp_proof_after_a_reset_without_processing`:
root702 run37766014784/job113273753509 (6.76s), then root427 run37770742963
(6.79s), both27 real bridge cases with26PASS/1FAIL and one auth subprocess role.
The failure was `capture timeline ownership changed` after a host reset with no
new DSP. The root427 raw log SHA256 is
`a426ee5da407973a569ed7b6f6a6c2c6e373d0f1f774266fe41f41150850c79a`.
Root125 run37775910822 independently repeated26PASS/1FAIL/1role at the same
line1386 before this repair was integrated. Raw log
`C:/Temp/windfall-125-windows-ci.log` has verified SHA256
`5f788bd632b3d3d524c9adc55ea0703859ef833977cad3327812716fd1ddc237`.
This is external pre-fix provenance, separate from the owner-run GREEN below.

An old HELPER_WRITE/native owner turn cannot be revoked by discarding READY/DONE.
It could finish after capture1/reset2 and legitimately restore native continuity
under epoch1. The old mapping did not publish host reset authority. A new
deterministic private owner-turn regression, using real VST3 native processing,
compiled RED at the exact ownership error (0.03s), then GREEN (0.02s). That
in-process test proves the ordering mechanism; the original separate-process
test independently passed unchanged (0.11s). No retry, delay, skip or oracle
relaxation obtains the result.

ABI4 adds header word28/byte112, a nonzero LE AtomicU32 timeline epoch, initially1.
After initialization only the sole Audio endpoint publishes it. Header word27
remains the independent owner-completion/liveness counter. Header length256B,
slot length85,824B and total mapping343,552B stay fixed. Slot transport16..29,
input epoch30/31 and reply identity32..39 stay disjoint and unchanged. Existing
u64 slot/control epochs are bounded to the nonzero u32 domain; no split-word
authority, Rust layout or native pointer is published.

Initialization Release-publishes1 off realtime; attach Acquires it and validates
the entire exact header before native loading. Reset checks local/header epoch
and counter bounds, invalidates local audio/COMPLETE proof/health acknowledgement,
prepares the new local block, discards only reclaimable READY/DONE, then performs
one strong AcqRel CAS. This final operation linearizes reset; new READY follows.
Overflow/corruption/CAS disagreement clears proof and latches failure without
wrap or clamp; only fresh-map restart restores availability. Current callback
authority is also checked before collecting output. This uses no callback wait,
lock, allocation/free, IO, clock, native call or resource retirement.

The helper Acquires/adopts authority around control/audio/idle turns. Adoption
invalidates continuity/held-note certainty without acknowledging native DSP.
Old admitted native work may finish and publish only old-tagged output/proof;
it cannot write the header or roll current metadata backward. A stale claimed
input not yet owner-turn admitted is released by its helper through a single
HELPER_WRITE->EMPTY Release CAS, with no DONE, native call or completion-counter
advance. Actual matching nonempty complete/no-drop DSP alone updates the separate
processed_epoch. Returned idle remains liveness evidence only.

Capture checks exact authority before native state work and after CLAP capture
or mandatory VST3 reactivation, including refusal recovery. The host checks
before enqueue, after reply and finally under its existing cache mutex. Reset
before that final Acquire refuses publication and retains the prior cache;
reset afterward leaves the successful result explicitly stamped with its old
epoch. Request-ID monotonic fencing remains. Native state/current controls and
pending committed intent keep their accepted separation. Reset, note snapshot,
adoption, capture and inactive reconciliation do not manufacture DSP proof.

Hello3 retains the40B WFAH/key record and rejects correctly keyed Hello1/2 before
any Load metadata. WFAP56B/version1/remaining startup budget and WFCB1 stay fixed.
Actual child-process tests assert zero disclosure for both old Hellos; an
authenticated new helper rejects ABI1/2/3 maps with no Ready and exit70. Exact
Region attach precedes native load in the helper. Existing eight-candidate
fairness, private key handling, deadlines, cancellation and reap rules remain.
Separate process containment is not a security sandbox.

The full ordering/layout/race matrix and diagnostic receipts are in
[process-bridge-reset-diagnosis.md](process-bridge-reset-diagnosis.md). Executed
checks so far:76 host library cases (including every explicitly built native
unit),31 bridge process cases plus its exercised subprocess role, and20 realtime
cases. Existing note-only overflow, incomplete-epoch proof, state bounds,
backpressure48MiB, capture faults, watchdog, no-drop and dry/silent oracles passed.
The320-call bridge guard recorded zero allocation/free calls, maximum4us and
average1us in this headless run; added corrupt/reset/late-output guards also
recorded zero calls. These are wall times, not a device deadline or CPU claim.
Persistent failure is tested to finish its existing64-frame transition without
restarting that ramp on each callback. Strict all-feature/all-target host Clippy
passed. No desktop/engine/native fixture/state/Cargo source changed.

Final post-audit timings were0.37s for all76 library cases and6.48s for the31
process cases. Initialization keeps authority zero until its first Release1;
there is no earlier relaxed1 for attach to acquire. Formatting and whitespace
checks passed, the original process test body is identical to6b, and the host-only
patch applies cleanly to copied exact root702 sources without production19f.

The five native owner-turn units follow the existing sticky-writer explicit
fixture convention and never build via nested Cargo. Mandatory full verification
with separately built `WINDFALL_BRIDGE_FIXTURE`, jobs1 and a private target is:
`cargo test -p windfall-plugin-host --lib -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1`.
All76 ran; none were omitted from this evidence. Normal library tests need no
fixture environment. Packaging, licensed corpus, device/editor and other-platform
bridge acceptance remain open; production preparation and meter gates remain
separate from this repair.

The owner has since advanced its worktree baseline to `7f70315c` (including
`19caf872`) at the parent's direction. The parent approved the proposed 2B
schedule and host-library edit window. Shared fixture classes10+ have a narrow
approved window. The historical leaf below preceded the later approved
production runtime/manager/main integration window. The initial512-frame default
delay was a proposal; the evidence
below now measures it with B=256 native helper fixtures, separately from B=64.
The owner subsequently imported reviewed R4 `ec601edf` in local merge
`02072c81`, using the parent's applied `ea145d93` composition to preserve the
accepted capture and native point-delivery repairs. The in-progress production
integration and ABI3 contract are recorded at the end of this document.

## Boundary and ownership

Each prepared CLAP/VST3 instance gets its own helper process, supervisor and
shared mapping. Native modules, instances, state calls and teardown stay in
that helper, on its creating thread. The desktop keeps the existing
`HostedEffect` / `HostedInstrument` factory facade. Playback selection still
occurs from installed audio blocks; speculative and independent render helpers
cannot become state owners. Capture requests and replies include a session,
instance token, document revision and binding identity. The desktop must check
the exact binding and installed selection before and after capture.

This is crash containment, not a security sandbox. Native code can access the
user's files and other processes with their permissions. Corrupt protocol data
is rejected; isolation does not make an intentionally hostile plugin safe.

## Accepted leaf ABI version 2 (historical; current integration uses ABI3)

Only 64-bit little-endian Windows is initially enabled. The mapping is a fixed
size, page-aligned array of aligned 32-bit words. No Rust enum, pointer, slice,
`Vec`, `Arc`, struct padding or native object crosses the boundary. Integers,
IEEE-754 floats and event discriminants have explicit byte offsets and
little-endian encodings. Every payload word uses an atomic relaxed load/store,
including metadata, so malformed helper publications cannot create a Rust
data race. Slot state uses acquire/release operations on aligned lock-free
32-bit atomics. This is an explicitly supported platform ABI, not a claim that
Rust structs or atomics have a portable cross-process representation.

The startup header records magic/version, mapping/header/slot sizes, four
slots, block capacity 512, event capacity 1153 (1024 ordinary + 129 reserved
releases), parameter capacity 4096, rate, selected block size, native latency,
kind, session/token/revision/binding identity and all section offsets. Validate
the exact computed layout, supported platform, capacities, overflow, alignment,
rate (8–384 kHz), block (1–512), latency (total at most one second), and identity
before any native load. Revalidate every slot length, event type/time/order,
note/channel/velocity, parameter ID/range/value and transport finite values.
Audio is planar stereo `f32`. Nonfinite input is sanitized locally. Nonfinite,
stale or corrupt output rejects the completed block and increments telemetry.

Each slot holds identity, sequence, transport, input/output audio, block-start
held-note and current-parameter snapshots, and ordered events. Snapshots allow
the helper to reconstruct current controls after skipped sequences without
replaying released notes. Admission/drop uncertainty also persists across
contiguous blocks: the next whole held snapshot must actually be reconciled
before its generation can be acknowledged, even without a parameter change. Ordinary overflow rejects note-ons and retains the
latest parameter for a later block; release admission has its own reserve.

Document commit, host admission and native processing are separate generations.
Submission and returning from the desktop facade never acknowledge processing.
Only a matching successfully acquired COMPLETE reply may advance the DSP
processed generation. Checked inactive capture reconciliation has a separate
generation and does not acknowledge DSP processing. A helper with
any native event/point admission failure must not acknowledge that generation;
it reports overflow and retains current desired controls for reconstruction.
Controller readback alone is not evidence that DSP processed a timed value.

This first engine facade addresses notes on channel zero and at most 128 keys;
the generic wire still validates 0–15 channels. Snapshots name the channel
explicitly. If ordinary admission saturates, note-ons stop entering. Reserved
releases coalesce only where an earlier release covers the same key/time and
no admitted note-on intervenes. There are at most 128 key releases and one
panic per block after ordinary admission stops. Earlier releases use ordinary
capacity; repeated releases/panics cannot consume an unbounded reserve. A
rejected release keeps the desired held snapshot updated, latches incomplete
control admission, and cannot be acknowledged as native processed.

Sequences/control generations/timeline epochs are monotonically increasing
64-bit counters. Before overflow they latch the instance failed; a new prepared
instance receives a fresh session and mapping rather than wrapping identifiers.
Reset/seek increments a timeline epoch, discards adapter accumulation/delayed
audio, and rejects replies from older epochs. Helpers reconstruct controls on
epoch or sequence discontinuity; output cannot resurrect a pre-seek note.

Slot ownership is `EMPTY -> HOST_WRITE -> READY -> HELPER_WRITE -> DONE ->
HOST_READ -> EMPTY`. Host and helper use bounded single-attempt CAS, never a
callback spin loop. Payload is published with Release; the next owner acquires
before reading. A late READY slot can be reclaimed only by a successful CAS
competing with the helper's claim. A HELPER_WRITE slot is never reclaimed while
that process lives. A DONE slot is acquired before copy/rejection. Four slots
bound backlog. Helper exit must be confirmed before control-side reclamation;
there is no in-place mapping restart that can expose an old helper's writes to
a new owner. Each fresh prepared instance uses a fresh session/mapping.

## Timing and fallback

The internal pipeline block is 256 frames by default, independent of host
callbacks (including 1/7/64/480/512 frames). Input block n is collected over
`[nB, (n+1)B)` and published at `(n+1)B`. Its output is tested once at `(n+2)B`
and played over `[(n+2)B, (n+3)B)`. Thus aggregation plus one scheduling block
adds **2B**, not B, frames. Report `native_latency + 2B` through the facade so
the existing graph PDC and dry/wet compensation account for it. An impulse
test must measure this delay rather than assuming it. Startup is silent until
the delayed input is available. A healthy worker may still miss the deadline;
fixed latency provides a work window, not a realtime completion guarantee.

Callback code only copies preallocated bounded buffers, encodes checked values,
and accesses mapped atomic words and telemetry. It never performs filesystem,
pipe, process or job IO, allocation/free, locks, clock calls or waits. Missing,
late, failed or corrupt output uses dry audio delayed by the same total latency
for effects, and silence for instruments. Availability transitions apply a
bounded sample ramp preserving continuity at the transition. Held notes and
latest parameters remain bounded during failure. No native plugin is loaded
into the desktop as an isolation fallback.

Offline helpers are separate instances and owners. Offline processing may wait
for the same sequence off realtime with a deadline and cancellation; output is
still passed through the identical block adapter and aligned by the same
latency. Streaming and offline scheduling differ. Waiting and success checks
observe the shared native-failure latch directly, independently of the
supervisor's later signal. Any offline error clears both supplied buffers so
partial/fallback audio cannot be mistaken for successful export output. The
staging owner must discard the complete artifact and flush the healthy delay
pipeline before publication. A failed export returns an error to the existing encoder staging owner; this module never publishes or
deletes output files, and never modifies the live plugin/document.

## Control and supervision

A bounded length-prefixed control protocol over an authenticated loopback TCP
connection is separate from mapped audio (native stdout cannot corrupt it).
Before any Load/path/state/mapping/owner metadata is sent, the supervisor
creates a 32-byte BCryptGenRandom system-preferred key. A new private child
stdin pipe carries a56-byte WFAP/version1 record: magic4, version4, key32,
expected session8 and remaining startup milliseconds8 (integers little endian).
No key/session/budget metadata is placed in CLI/environment/logs. The child
sends a fixed40-byte Hello: WFAH magic4, Hello version2 (4 LE), nonce32. Malformed,
wrong-version/key and stalled clients receive zero metadata and are closed.
At most eight candidates are polled without blocking; a full stalled set
releases its oldest candidate for a newcomer. Candidate age is 50 ms, and the
whole startup retains deadline/cancellation/child-exit bounds. RNG, pipe or
authentication failure fails closed and the child owner reaps on unwinding.
This prevents an unrelated first loopback client from obtaining the launch
payload; it is not a security sandbox or privileged-adversary defense.
Hello version2, private bootstrap version1 and control framing version1 are
distinct from mapping ABI2;
none has a downgrade path.
The 24-byte little-endian frame prefix bounds metadata to 1 MiB and native
state to256MiB including the WFPS wrapper. Native save can succeed at its
raw256MiB cap while exceeding this complete-container wire budget; both
capture paths return a recoverable control error before reply framing.
Partial reads retain framing state;
there is one reader and no abandoned blocked reader thread per timeout.
Load, state capture/restore, editor refusal, and shutdown carry request IDs and
the full owner identity; state bytes use the existing checked WFPS/VST3
container. Transport and automation use only the audio path. Control IO and
native calls run away from audio. Native VST3 capture proves deactivation and
captures/reprepares on the helper owner; refusal retains the exact adapter and
returns an error. CLAP capture preserves its accepted active-state semantics.
Retain the last validated successful state; cache publication is fenced by
serialized request ID so an older caller cannot overwrite a newer capture.
A truncated/malformed/stale reply cannot replace it. Retained DSP proof is
bound to the actual processing epoch, even when VST3 capture clears sequence
continuity; inactive reconciliation never relabels old DSP proof after reset. Pending controls have finite deadlines; hung native work
ends by killing only that helper and waiting for its exit.

Header word27 (byte108) is a bounded u32 native-owner completion counter.
The helper publishes it with Release only after the synchronous native
process/control and idle owner turn returns; the supervisor observes Acquire.
It is liveness evidence only, never admission or DSP-generation proof. No-work
idle/stopped sessions do not arm the watchdog. Outstanding work arms a fresh
age; READY turnover and temporary empty gaps cannot reset it. Actual owner
completion may disarm that obligation; new outstanding work then starts fresh.
The helper exits before counter wrap; restart uses a new session/map. This
bounds a helper lifetime to at most u32::MAX owner turns, independently of the
64-bit audio sequence/generation limits.

The supervisor detects death, startup/control timeouts and stalled published
audio progress. All such failures latch that instance unavailable. No automatic
retry storm: retries are explicit, recreate identity and mapping through the
factory revision, and use a bounded per-binding failure budget and cooldown.
After the budget, report blocked until explicit user retry/rescan. Retirement
is control-side: stop, kill on deadline, reap, close pipes/map handles and join
workers. The audio half retains its resources until the engine's existing
control-side retirement; a supervisor must not unmap an active audio view.

The packaged desktop executable will recognize an audio-helper mode before
starting Tauri, as it already does for scanning. Test binaries may use a
standalone helper. Production discovery must use the current executable, not
Cargo target paths. Native editor requests return an explicit unsupported
error in this first delivery. Parenting, scaling, focus and editor lifecycle
remain followup work. Manager health/retry/selection require coordinated
shared wiring; persisted wrapper options are outside this patch.

## Dependencies and verification

Use existing serde/serde_json, rtrb and Windows bindings. The approved feature
addition enables Memory/Security/Cryptography in existing `windows-sys` **0.61.2**, whose
only locked package dependency is existing `windows-link` **0.2.1**. Both local
registry manifests declare MIT OR Apache-2.0, compatible with the GPL project.
The feature change adds no package, lockfile change, native library download or
version upgrade. Mapping pages are pre-touched on control before installation;
OS memory residency is not promised by headless tests.
Portable followup uses the same explicit byte protocol with OS shared mappings
and verified aligned lock-free atomics on each supported architecture. It
requires actual macOS/Linux execution and their native main-thread lifecycle.

Required checks include malformed layouts and identity/events; adapter impulse,
variable callbacks, parameter/note saturation, seeks/reset, fallback ramps and
allocator counters; real helper crash/hang/state-capture death, cleanup and
independent instances; healthy native CLAP/VST3 reference comparison; engine
PDC/routing/automation/export/stems; desktop save/undo/replacement/recording
barriers and manager controls. Maximum callback duration is reported separately
from average CPU, with no hardware deadline claim from headless tests.

Packaged installer discovery, licensed Surge/OB-Xf Windows corpus with exact
versions/formats/settings/output, native editors and other platforms remain
external verification gates. Generated bindings/descriptors/WASM and global
parity updates belong to the parent.

## Implementation evidence

Implemented in new owned host modules: explicit protocol/slot transport,
Windows mapping, preallocated callback adapter, independent render scheduling,
bounded control framing, creating-thread native helper and per-instance
supervisor. The standalone `windfall-plugin-audio` binary is exercised on
Windows/MSVC; production desktop activation remains deferred under the
parent's existing runtime/main/manager edit reservation.

Current Windows headless evidence:

- Twenty-one bridge unit checks pass, including exact layout/identity/events,
  corrupt output, late helper-owned slot preservation, overflow snapshots,
  epoch rejection, no submission acknowledgement, continuous fallback ramps,
  counter exhaustion, transport-bound exhaustion without callback panic,
  bounded retry/cooldown/stale-attempt rejection and local-reference delay.
- Twenty process integration checks pass (one additional ignored test is an
  explicitly invoked client subprocess role): CLAP native crash, nonfinite samples and a
  helper deadline exceeded by a slow native block are terminated/reaped while
  the parent stays alive with aligned dry fallback; VST3 processing errors and
  nonfinite samples are likewise contained. Newly appended CLAP/VST3 permanent
  native process hangs are terminated; a CLAP on_main_thread permanent hang is
  killed while B=256/48k callbacks keep replacing expired READY slots.
- Healthy CLAP/VST3 native state capture and in-process restore preserve real
  values; different instances use different helper PIDs and retiring one
  leaves the other healthy. Unsupported native editor requests return an
  explicit error.
- Independent offline helpers match actual in-process deterministic fixture
  output at precision `1e-7`, using full, unsplit callback sizes
  **1/7/64/480/512** and a measured extra **128 frames for B=64**. CLAP sine
  begins at exact onset 160 (first nonzero sine sample 161), verifying real
  native 32 + bridge 128 latency and note release. The current VST3 gain fixture
  advertises 17 frames but does not implement an audio delay; its reported PDC
  latency is 145 while comparison measures only actual bridge-added 128.
  It cannot establish truthful native-latency acoustic alignment.
- With the default B=256, independent real CLAP/VST3 gain helpers place an
  impulse at exactly **512 frames** under offline scheduling. CLAP reports 512
  total; the undelayed VST3 fixture reports 529.
- Newly appended truthful delayed CLAP and VST3 effect fixtures implement a
  preallocated 37-frame stereo delay. Healthy helper audio and delayed dry
  fallback after confirmed termination both begin at **165 frames for B=64**
  and **549 for B=256**, exactly matching the adapter's latency report. VST3
  class 10 follows the unchanged original classes 0–9; scanner count is 18 (classes11-17 add process hang, held-key probe and fault fixtures).
  Engine graph PDC/routing/dry-wet integration remains unverified until wiring.
- Before any native DSP block, capture retains pending parameter intent without
  claiming DSP acknowledgement. CLAP stays active: its opaque state retains
  actual 0.5 while the separate companion value carries pending 0.75. VST3
  reconciles inactive state to 0.75 and reports a separate reconciliation
  generation. Both report DSP generation zero. Rejected capture metadata
  preserves the previous validated state and leaves a healthy helper alive.
- Separate offline native helpers return cancellation/deadline errors with
  both supplied buffers cleared on error. Explicit control-side termination
  confirms exit while audio retains its mapping for allocation-free fallback,
  and an independent live helper stays healthy. Exit bookkeeping reports reaped
  only after confirmed process exit, with a bounded termination deadline.
- A calibrated thread-local allocator guard records zero callback alloc,
  realloc and free calls through startup, full/late slots, parameter/note
  saturation, reset and latched failure with variable callbacks. One recorded
  run of 320 calls measured maximum 73 microseconds and average 1 microsecond;
  the final R1 run observed maximum 9 and average 1 microseconds.
  Maximum and average are separate wall-clock observations on a busy machine,
  not CPU utilization or a physical audio deadline claim.
- Strict host Clippy with **all features and all targets**, and the appended
  VST3 factory/scanner count check,
  and formatting pass. Native processed acknowledgement is conditional on
  separate event admission success, a matching successful nonempty native
  completion, and unchanged nonsaturated dropped counters taken immediately
  before/after native processing. Native input/output losses are separately
  observable and retain desired controls. R4 prerequisite source is accepted;
  production use still awaits independent bridge-repair acceptance.
- All twenty existing realtime checks pass, including native CLAP/VST3
  allocator, note-release reserve and ownership regressions. The fixture was
  built separately and the test executable run directly to keep one Cargo
  process per owner.

Pending: production factory/manager/helper mode and adopted document metadata,
semantic-native-state validation, save/undo/replacement/recording barriers, engine PDC/routing/export
and stems, manager wiring for the tested retry budget, packaged installer discovery, licensed
corpus, native editors and other OS execution. Existing state bytes are opaque:
checked container/stream validity is enforced, but this does not prove an
arbitrary plugin can restore every semantically malformed native payload.

## ABI2 byte offsets and R1 repair evidence

All integer fields below are little endian. Header length is 256 bytes, each
slot 85,824 bytes, mapping 343,552 bytes. Slot i starts at 256 + i * 85,824.
No shared Rust layout defines these offsets. Unlisted startup header words
must be zero; attach rejects ABI1 or any size/offset/identity mismatch before
native load. Latency negotiation updates byte44 before audio installation.

| Header byte offset | Field |
| --- | --- |
| 0/4 | WFBR magic / mapping version2 |
| 8/12/16/20 | mapping bytes / header words / slot words / slot count |
| 24/28/32 | max block512 / events1153 / parameters4096 |

| 8960 | up to4096 parameters: u32 id + f64 value (12B each) |
| 58112 | up to1153 events, six u32 words (24B each) |

Event tags 1/2 are on/off: tag,time,key,channel,f32 velocity,zero. Tag3 is
panic: tag,time,then zeros. Tag4 is parameter: tag,time,id,zero,f64 value.
Control framing remains WFCB/version1: 4B magic,4B version,8B request,
4B metadata length,4B state length, followed by checked JSON and WFPS bytes.

The six source-review counterexamples were reproduced before repair:

- Watchdog: real CLAP idle/main-thread hang at B64 and requested B256/48k
  evaded the old timer during READY turnover; bounded RED, then GREEN reap.
  Healthy no-work idle/reset and 120 variable callback turns stay alive without
  fabricated DSP acknowledgement; temporary empty obligations/counter rollover
  have deterministic unit coverage.
- Notes: 1024 admitted key60 note-ons plus rejected key69 falsely acknowledged
  the continuous next generation with native key-probe output zero (RED).
  CLAP/VST3 now actually output one for key69 before matching COMPLETE ack,
  and a later release actually returns the native marker to zero.
- Offline: native shared failure/DONE with delayed supervisor flag returned Ok
  (RED); now Err(Failed) with both buffers zero (GREEN).
- Epoch: two real VST3 captures around reset without new DSP returned old
  generation under epoch2 (RED); epoch2 now carries zero DSP proof (GREEN).
- Cache: reversed cloned-caller publication overwrote request2 with request1
  (barrier RED); monotonic request fencing preserves request2 (GREEN).
- Authentication: restoring first-client acceptance made the real unrelated
  client consume Load and reset the connection (compiled RED); private-key
  Hello gates metadata (GREEN), including eight stalled first sockets and a
  wrong Hello. Wrong intended-child key and startup cancellation fail closed
  with bounded process reap. Crypto-failure propagation is implemented;
  actual OS RNG failure is not artificially induced.

Strict all-feature/all-target Clippy, fixture formatting and scanner counts
are rerun for the source-only response commit. These tests remain headless
Windows evidence; no production desktop activation, installed-package helper
claim, licensed-corpus result, native editor parity or other-OS claim follows.

## Capture and output-fault followup

After the fixed R1 response ba61a255, new CLAP bridge IDs and VST3 classes13-17
append capture-exit, capture-hang, partial-state refusal, unsupported latency
and output-event flood. Previous IDs/classes0-12 retain their behavior.
Capture faults trigger only after actual gain0.75 DSP so gain0.5 can establish
a real last validated state first. Both formats preserve that cached state on
exit/hang/refusal; permanent capture hangs are terminated under a100ms control
deadline, and an independent live instance remains healthy. Truncated3-byte
native writes followed by explicit save failure are rejected; recovery can
subsequently capture a healthy state again.

Actual native u32::MAX latency is latched unavailable and reported as an
explicit unsupported-native-latency startup error before audio installation;
a compiled RED showed that the earlier generic EOF hid the reason. Completed
authenticated control errors are decoded before considering child exit so the
bounded startup error remains visible. Native loss-counter exhaustion or
observed rollover terminates the helper; it cannot later claim affirmative
no-drop proof from a wrapped counter.

A5000-output-event fixture in each format proves native loss telemetry is
visible, lost/unknown generations receive no DSP acknowledgement, and desired
controls recover in actual healthy blocks after the flood is disabled. CLAP
fills owner notifications; VST3 fills its fixed SDK output note-event list.
Repeated same-offset VST3 parameter points coalesce by SDK contract, so that
would not constitute a capacity proof. Callback guards remain zero alloc/free.

The parent approved a narrow shared-host state-writer repair. LimitedWriter
now retains every refusal, uses checked size arithmetic, and refuses subsequent
writes/flush. CLAP save checks that sticky failure even if native code reports
success. A new CLAP-only bridge-ignored-stream-error ID deliberately ignores
the first refused write and returns success. Existing VST3 classes0-17 stay
unchanged, with factory/scanner count18. A32-byte native-boundary unit compiled
RED when partial bytes were accepted and GREEN after the guard; the helper's
actual256MiB cap compiled RED when the oversized reply lost the native owner.
GREEN preserves the previous cache, rejects capture, and completes healthy DSP
and capture on that same owner. The small-limit native unit is explicitly
ignored by default because it requires the separately built owned fixture; its
explicit fixture-backed invocation passes. The VST3 host already retains
sticky stream failure. These checks do not establish semantic validity of
arbitrary opaque native state or native editor behavior.

## R2 proof, startup backpressure and offline completion

DSP proof has a separate processed_epoch tag. Only the complete, matching,
nonempty successful native process with successful admission and affirmative
no-drop evidence can advance this tag with its processed generation. Current
native epoch/sequence may advance on an incomplete block without advancing
proof. Actual CLAP/VST3 regression compiled RED after epoch1 healthy DSP, reset,
then the first epoch2 note-overflow block: capture relabeled old proof under
epoch2. GREEN returns zero DSP proof, then acknowledges a later healthy epoch2
block. The earlier no-intervening-DSP VST3 capture regression remains green.

Authentication still completes before any Load disclosure. Startup Load now
writes incrementally on the authenticated nonblocking socket in at most64KiB
chunks. Every partial-write/retry checks the whole startup deadline,
cancellation and child exit; WouldBlock yields only on the control thread.
No truncation, retry of an entire already-partial frame, downgrade or local
DSP acknowledgement is allowed. The private debug test executable pauses
native Load reads500ms and only that test launch clamps SO_SNDBUF to4096; the
production socket buffer is unchanged. Existing windows-sys0.61 gained only
the approved Win32_Networking_WinSock feature, with no package/version/lock
change. Scripted old write_all compiled RED on WouldBlock; incremental writes
preserve exact framing across partial/Interrupted/WouldBlock responses and
stop on an injected deadline (GREEN). The actual supervisor::launch16MiB
valid native state completed with5017 observed WouldBlock retries in the
final run, then produced matching healthy audio and captured/restored state. Its native
inversion setting exists only in opaque state, outside the Load gain table,
so parameter adoption cannot hide a lost restore.
The old single large write_all still passed on this Windows machine even
with the clamp; this is not claimed as an executed native RED. Actual startup
cancel/deadline during backpressure refuse launch within the bounded control
budget and reclaim the mapping. Authentication's eight candidates and stale
owner/identity/framing checks remain unchanged. Not a security sandbox or
protection from a privileged adversary.

Offline scheduling rechecks cancellation/deadline/shared failure after DONE
and before final success. A private deterministic wait seam publishes DONE
simultaneously with cancellation or expiry: both compiled RED returning Ok,
then GREEN returning the precise error. The tests also consume a valid first
chunk before the failed final chunk and prove both entire128-frame supplied
buffers are cleared. Realtime process keeps no clock, wait or control IO.

Final narrow verification:24 bridge units,24 real-process integration cases
(plus one explicitly child-invoked ignored role), the fixture-backed CLAP
state unit and state-writer units pass. The calibrated320-callback run records
zero alloc/realloc/free, max5us and average1us wall time. Host lib48 cases
pass (plus the explicitly invoked ignored native state unit), all20 realtime
cases and both scanner cases pass; the scanner sees18 VST3 classes. Existing
parameter/state regressions also pass. These headless busy
Windows observations do not establish physical audio deadlines. Strict
all-feature/all-target host Clippy, host and complete fixture formatting, and
git diff --check pass for delivery. Production routing, engine
PDC/routing/export/stems, save/undo/replacement/recording integration, packaged
installer discovery, licensed Windows corpus, native editors and other OSes
remain open acceptance gates.

## R3 Load and native-wrapper boundary response

Immutable e6696dd3 source review raised two counterexamples, both reproduced
with compiled real-process RED before repair. A valid48MiB native state with
opaque inversion outside the Load parameter table failed at5.11s despite a
15s caller startup deadline. Decoder read at most8KiB but the old helper slept
1ms after each successful incomplete read and kept a separate fixed5s limit.
The progress-aware decoder now performs one bounded8KiB read/decode step,
checks deadlines before and after the step, drains available bytes without
sleep, and sleeps only on no-progress WouldBlock. EOF/truncated input fails,
never loops as idle. The control supervisor also drains bounded progress with
its cancellation/child-exit/deadline checks intact. No callback waits/IO/clock
or processing acknowledgement is added. Native48MiB launch now completes
healthy DSP/state capture/restore, while the16MiB case remains green.

Supported startup capability is a positive Duration no greater than60seconds.
Invalid/oversized budgets are rejected before file/listener/map/spawn/native
side effects; no silent clamp. Parent's absolute deadline starts at launch and
remains authoritative across spawn, private pipe transfer, authentication,
Load retries and Ready. The fixed56B private record carries WFAP/version1,
key32/session8/remaining-ms8. Remaining budget is derived at actual pipe write
with checked ceiling conversion: a positive submillisecond remainder becomes
1ms, and parent absolute expiry still wins. Child validates nonzero<=60000ms,
starts its finite local origin, and bounds connection/Hello/Load from it.
Hello2 rejects oldHello1 before any Load disclosure; old40B bootstrap,
unknown-version/zero/over-limit records fail closed. Mapping ABI2/WFCB1 remain
unchanged. No downgrade, CLI/environment metadata, new dependency, facade or
state-format change follows. Launch key is cleared before native loading.
Units cover zero/submillisecond/exact60s/>60s/conversion overflow, expired and
cancelled pre-pipe writes sending nothing, private versions and oldHello1.
The real unrelated-client case includes eight stalled sockets, a wrong-key
Hello2 and an oldHello1; none receives metadata. Deadline/cancellation still
reclaims the failed startup mapping and child on the parent control owner.

New CLAP bridge-state-boundary and appended VST3 class18 stream exactly the
existing native raw256MiB cap using bounded8KiB buffers (no giant repo asset).
VST3 component supplies MAX-24, ordinary controller8 plus native VST2 header16
completes the raw cap; prior classes0-17/IDs and R4 point/drop behavior stay
unchanged. Each successful native save adds WFPS6, exceeding the wire cap.
Both CLAP and VST3 compiled RED losing the healthy owner on packet validation;
GREEN emits the explicit wrapper-budget control error, retains cached bytes,
keeps the same PID, and resumes actual healthy DSP and native capture. VST3
still reactivates after failed capture. Warm initial DSP makes the comparison
independent of inactive pending-parameter container differences. Checked
full-frame size/header tests cover raw payloads below/at/above MAX-6 and the
full nativeMAX case, metadata maximum, oversized lengths and arithmetic bounds
without allocating near-limit unit payloads. Opaque semantic validity remains
outside this byte/stream acceptance proof.

This response preserves all earlier R1/R2 regressions. The R2 old single
16MiB write_all still passed actual Windows even with SO_SNDBUF4096; its RED
remains scripted partial/WouldBlock mechanism evidence. R3's48MiB timeout is
an actual native RED and is a separate finding. Final scoped checks on this
response passed: host lib52 (including28 bridge units), explicit small-limit
native CLAP state unit1, real bridge process27, realtime20, parameter/state11,
scanner2, strict all-feature/all-target host Clippy, host/full fixture formatting
and whitespace checks. The process suite's one ignored entry is the child role
invoked by the authentication regression. Final16/48MiB launches recorded
1030/1192 WouldBlock retries; the complete process suite finished in7.08s.
The callback guard recorded320 calls, zero alloc/realloc/free, max3us/average1us
on this busy headless Windows machine; earlier same-source runs reached13us,
so these observations do not establish a physical callback deadline bound.
Control decoding boxes completed packets off realtime to satisfy strict Clippy;
shared audio payload/slot ownership and callback code are unchanged.
Production routing remains closed
pending independent leaf acceptance; engine/document integration, packaged
installer, licensed Windows corpus, native editors/other OSes and hardware
acceptance remain open.

## Production desktop integration window (in progress)

The Windows desktop executable recognizes audio-helper mode before Tauri. Windows
factories resolve current_exe and launch one authenticated helper per prepared
CLAP/VST3 instance; private test constructors inject the explicitly built current
desktop executable. Existing native-owner/R4 test fixtures keep their historical
in-process provider solely in cfg(test). No production native fallback is used.
Discovery itself now obtains initial state/parameter metadata from a disposable
authenticated helper, not a desktop-native instance. Selected playback capture
continues to require exact binding, document revision and selected token before
and after the control operation; render/speculative helpers never select targets.

The facade retains preallocated audio buffers, shared metadata and a retirement
flag. Helper controls/status/resources remain on the desktop control owner.
Engine facade destruction remains a control-side operation; its retired flag lets
that owner reap the process without joining on the callback. Startup, failure and
retry errors use the existing manager error channel. Manual retry advances the
existing factory revision; there is no automatic retry storm. Bridge editor
requests explicitly return unsupported and cannot open an in-process native
editor. This remains crash containment, not a security sandbox.

Parameter adoption only records equivalence with an existing desired generation
and a collection sequence frontier. It emits no event, desired-counter increment,
submit, IPC or native acknowledgement. A matching timely COMPLETE sequence at
or after that frontier is required to publish processed local/document metadata.
Timeline reset clears that proof. Capture retains committed pending intent
separately from actual native bytes and inactive reconciliation.

Each offline render obtains its own provider/error latch and helpers. It may wait
up to two seconds per bridge process operation off realtime; cancellation is
observed between bounded operations. A helper process error zeros the supplied
operation buffers and latches a render error. Reporting APIs discard collected
results on that error; checked streaming/stems return an explicit plugin error
although a prefix may already have reached the sink. The desktop discards every
staged file and preserves destinations. Ordinary cancellation and sampler errors
remain distinct. These statements describe the implementation contract; compiled
production evidence follows below. The existing nonWindows native provider is
preserved and does not gain crash isolation from this Windows-only window.

The seven-path native metadata prerequisite94e168ae is imported alone as1fa5a16d,
directly atop0741117f; no T1parent/full branch is imported. Current engine producer
remains None until the separately coordinated full Song meter-map producer lands.
Both desktop facades faithfully forward Some anchors. ABI3 now carries14 atomic
LE transport words at16..29: words0..2 playing/numerator/denominator, word3 flag
None0/Some1, words4..9 existing tempo/beats/seconds f64, words10/11 anchor origin
f64, word12 zero-based cumulative index, word13 reserved zero. None requires the
extra words zero and retains scalar negative positions. Some requires finite
nonnegative origin<=position and checked i32 cumulative index. Input epoch moves
to30/31, reply identity stays32..39; all later metadata/payload offsets and mapping
size are unchanged. Units audit all used metadata ranges for overlap and reject
ABI1/2, malformed anchors/reserved words/overflow before native installation.
Hello2/private WFAP1/WFCB1 remain unchanged. Fullproducer malformed meter refusal
must remain a SamplerPreparation(Unsupported) preparation error, never Plugin,
when the parent later composes that prerequisite.

### Production-window evidence and remaining gates

The current desktop executable was explicitly built in the owner target and
injected into tests, exercising its real helper entry before Tauri. This is
development executable discovery evidence, not packaged-installer evidence.
All four CLAP/VST3 effect/instrument Session routes use child PIDs, selected
playback tokens, current document revision and real native state. Unsupported
editors are explicit refusals. Startup/failure errors use manager instance errors;
there is no production in-process native fallback on Windows.

The truthful37-frame effect measures549 frames at the bridge facade (37+2*256).
An actual Session clip impulse at1024 appears at1585 in live graph audio: an
additional12 frames from the source instrument plus549 from the facade. Graph
latency is561. Independent offline results remove the graph delay, retain the
impulse at1024, and match bit-for-bit across1/7/64/480/512-frame chunks. The live
variable-callback test counts zero allocator calls. These are synthetic software
measurements, not physical device deadline or licensed plugin evidence.

The adoption unit compiled RED when mismatched committed0.75 was equated with
existing desired0.625. GREEN retains equivalence only for matching values and
waits for a later completed sequence. Adoption changes no desired generation or
native event count. Four actual native Song-automation cases preserve processed
0.25 after deduplicated committed0.75 adoption. Local metadata tuples use a
single callback writer and sequentially consistent atomic payload/version access;
equal even versions fence epoch/generation capture without callback locks.

Appended fixture19 has truthful37-frame stereo delay and returns an actual
native process error at gain>=0.75. Both formats produce a healthy prefix and
then fail the final Song processing block. Collected reporting audio is wholly
discarded; checked streaming and both stem modes return Plugin errors. Desktop
mix and multi-file stem export discard all staging, publish no Written outcome,
and preserve a destination replaced by a competing writer. A fresh healthy
Pattern render/stem operation succeeds, and the live sibling PID/token/document
remain unchanged. The separate pure factory regression fails on the final
one-frame block of a16001-frame render after16000 valid frames and verifies
simultaneous final progress cancellation cannot mask the plugin error.

Appended VST-only fixture20 retains the same truthful37 latency while making a
newer deactivation edit0.625->0.375. The actual fixture compiled RED when the
desktop intent overlay restored0.625; GREEN keeps inactive reconciliation's
native readback, subsequent healthy DSP0.1875 at input0.5, and a second capture
0.375 on the same PID. The earlier class7 probe instead latched its dynamic
17->64 latency change; that probe is not overlay RED evidence. Fixtures0-18,
IDs and R4 point/drop semantics remain unchanged; scanner count21 is mechanical.
These six fixture paths are frozen separately in71dbec11. Creator thread identity
hooks and the new native_thread module are now the portability owner's exclusive
window; this owner will not modify those hooks or import its branch.

Real facade crash/nonfinite/hang tests retain finite delayed effect fallback,
reap the failed helper within its bound, expose a manual-retry manager error and
keep the healthy sibling process/token alive. Four native pending-control cases
save and back up0.75 without intervening audio/adoption/native processing, preserve
undo/redo and live document contents, refuse save/backup/refresh/New during a take,
and invalidate old capture tokens after New/Open. Callback allocator guards cover
these paths and normal processing; off-thread process and control waits remain
bounded. Actual synchronous Session preparation still inherits native waits under
State/controller guards. The parent assigned a separate preparation owner; this
gap is unaccepted until guarded off-lock construction and retirement are composed
and tested. No asynchronous prewarm or assumed-latency shortcut closes it.

The current checks retain all27 real process regressions from the accepted leaf,
61 host units plus the explicitly invoked sticky native CLAP writer case,20 host
realtime cases,11 parameter/state cases and2 scanner cases. Engine checks passed:
3 error-reporting units,37 effect/render/allocator cases,11 existing stem cases
and11 existing sampler-processing cases. Desktop checks passed21 new native
Session cases,2 private facade units and all5 unchanged native R4 regressions.
Strict all-feature/all-target host, engine all-target and desktop lib/tests
Clippy, workspace/full-fixture formatting and whitespace checks passed.
The final21-case desktop run measured25 callbacks per role with zero allocator
calls: CLAP effect max120us/mean69.42us, CLAP instrument82.5us/37.128us,
VST3 effect137.5us/67.492us, VST3 instrument60.2us/37.868us. Earlier runs reached
different maxima. These are headless wall times on a busy machine, not average
CPU or a physical device deadline guarantee.
The seven imported native metadata paths and two mechanical desktop transport
literals are the complete metadata prerequisite adaptation. The one VST processor
formatting hunk removes a blank line introduced while preserving the R4 refusal
test during that prerequisite cherry-pick; it changes no native point behavior.

Full Song meter production and malformed-meter refusal await the parent's exact
producer handover. Whole preparation/document-race acceptance, packaged installer
helper discovery, licensed Surge/OB-Xf corpus, Windows devices, native editor
parenting/scaling/lifecycle, and other platforms remain open. The independently
reproduced macOS entry and Linux fixture-TLS failures belong to the portability
owner and are not repaired or claimed passed by this Windows evidence. N4 remains
partial; a separate process provides crash containment, not a security sandbox.
## ABI3 native meter metadata prerequisite

This isolated prerequisite imports no production facade, helper discovery,
manager routing or render-error work. The seven-path native metadata commit
94e168ae was imported alone as1fa5a16d, directly atop0741117f. Fixture checkpoint
71dbec11 remains separate; its creator identity hooks belong exclusively to the
portability owner. No T1 parent/full branch or local020 merge is imported.

Mapping ABI3 carries fourteen explicit LE atomic transport words at16..29.
Relative words0..2 retain playing/numerator/denominator; word3 is None0/Some1;
words4..9 retain tempo/beats/seconds f64; words10/11 are the optional anchor
origin f64, word12 its zero-based cumulative index, and word13 reserved zero.
None requires words10..13 zero and preserves legacy scalar negative positions.
Some requires a finite nonnegative origin<=absolute beat and a checked i32 bar
index. Epoch moves to30/31; reply identity stays32..39. Other offsets, slot/map
sizes, atomic payload/CAS ownership and owner-completion semantics are unchanged.
The full metadata-range audit proves no overlaps. ABI1/2, malformed/nonfinite
anchors, reserved words and overflow are refused before native installation.
Hello2/WFAP1/WFCB1 are unchanged; there is no downgrade.

The native desktop facade faithfully forwards the optional anchor. The two full
desktop transport literals gain only meter_anchor:None. The readonly local
collection_frontier getter changes no generation/event; completed_proof supplies
only an earlier matching, timely COMPLETE epoch/sequence/processed generation and
clears on reset. Neither getter turns adoption, submit, or owner liveness into DSP
acknowledgement. The control write method retains the parent's cfg(windows|test)
guard, preserving Windows production and all-platform partial-write units.

Checks on this isolated source passed:61 host library units,27 real bridge
process cases,20 realtime cases, strict all-feature/all-target host Clippy,
engine all-target Clippy, desktop lib/tests Clippy, workspace/full-fixture
formatting and whitespace checks. The ordinary library/process suites retain
their two explicit child/native-test roles as ignored entries. The new getter
unit checks readonly counters, no proof on submit or DONE publication alone,
matching output collection, unknown-output proof retention and reset; the
old-epoch regression additionally checks the getter stays empty.

The existing native ABI-builder tests and bridge codec/layout/process tests
exercise these seams. No new actual native bar-readback fixture is claimed. The
full Song meter producer is separately coordinated by the parent. Production
routing/renderer integration and the inherited native preparation/retirement
under State/controller guards remain unaccepted pending the larger leaf and P1.
N4 stays partial; separate processes provide crash containment, not a sandbox.

## Production Spec R1: settled controls during pending note capture

The source review of frozen19f6ddc2 identified a distinct stale-table failure.
Record capture cloned launch-time parameter specs and refreshed only unsettled
or pending document controls. After native gain0.625 was processed and collected,
an unprocessed note advanced overall desired generation. The helper correctly
considered capture reconciliation, but received stale settled gain0.5. CLAP's
companion value could regress; VST3 could also write0.5 into opaque native state.

Two actual Session regressions compiled RED in0.87s, returning0.5 instead of0.625
for both formats. They launch stable-latency instruments at0.5, commit0.625,
collect completed blocks, then admit a note in a1-frame callback without
publishing its incomplete B256 input. Two actual helper/facade regressions
compiled RED in0.17s with the same values. Those additionally prove matching
completed processing and settled document metadata before the note: desired2,
processed2; note intent alone advances desired3 while proof remains processed2.

The narrow fix initializes every transmitted spec value from its current
ParameterControl snapshot before matching pending document overrides. It does
not change host capture semantics, inactive native reconciliation, native points,
desired/adoption counters, processed proof, ownership or ABI. Both native pairs
then passed: helper/facade cases0.47s, Session cases0.73s. Assertions preserve
processed2 after capture at desired3, distinguish VST inactive reconciliation
from DSP, retain0.625 through capture/save/reopen, and honor a newer pending
document0.75. An independent authenticated helper restores only the saved opaque
state with an empty parameter-override table, then reads actual native metadata;
both formats report0.625. Callback allocator guards remain zero.

Final scoped checks passed all23 N4 native Session cases and4 owned facade units,
desktop lib/tests strict Clippy, host all-feature/all-target strict Clippy,
workspace/full-fixture formatting and whitespace checks. The23-case run took
15.78s. The measured25-callback role maxima were123.4/50.6/81.6/48.4us for
CLAP effect/instrument and VST3 effect/instrument respectively, with zero
allocator calls; these remain busy-machine headless wall times rather than a
hardware deadline guarantee. Host/engine source and historical R4 test bodies
are unchanged by this repair; their earlier native results are not new reruns.

This response owns only desktop plugins/bridge.rs, appended Session plugin tests
and this document, directly atop immutable19f6ddc2. No fixture/native_thread,
host state API, engine, preparation, runtime or shared identity path changes.
The optional P3 refactors are deferred. The preparation-lock/retirement and
missing full meter-producer precheck gates remain material and open; production
activation and source integration require the parent's fresh full-context review.
